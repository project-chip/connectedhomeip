# Gemini Code Review Instructions

- Do not comment on content for XML files or .matter content for clusters
- Assume the matter specification is unknown and out of scope. Do not make uninformed assumptions about the Matter specification, or its contents.
- Do not comment unless a change is probably desirable 
- Do not repeat yourself. Be concise without losing meaning
- Do not over-explain what you see in the code. Only describe code if there are specific questions or concerns (or if a question is asked)
- Ensure that extensions or fixes to existing code should match the prevailing style of the original code
- Look for common typos and suggest fixes
