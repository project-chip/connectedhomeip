/**
 *    @file
 *      This file describes a QRCode Setup Payload generator based on the
 *      CHIP specification.
 *
 *      The encoding of the binary data to a base41 string is as follows:
 *      - Every 2 bytes (16 bits) of binary source data are encoded to 3
 *        characters of the Base-45 alphabet.
 *      - If an odd number of bytes are to be encoded, the remaining
 *        single byte is encoded to 2 characters of the Base-45 alphabet.
