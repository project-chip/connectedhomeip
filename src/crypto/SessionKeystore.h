 * session keys in a secure environment. It uses the concept of key handles that isolate the
 * application from the actual key material.
 *
 * @note Refactor has begun to refactor this API into two disctinct APIs : SymmetrycKeyStore & SessionKeyDerivation
 *       Work has not been completed so the  SessionKeystore has APIs that shouldn't go together for the time being
 *       The SessionKeystore APIs are split into two sections, one for each futur API.
