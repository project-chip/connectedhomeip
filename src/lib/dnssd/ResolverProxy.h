/**
 * Convenience class for discovering Matter commissioners and commissionable nodes.
 *
 * The class simplifies the usage of the global DNS-SD resolver to discover Matter nodes by managing
 * the lifetime of the discovery context object.
 *
 * The proxy provides a method to register an external commissioning delegate whose
 * `OnNodeDiscovered` method is called whenever a new node is discovered. The delegate is
 * automatically unregistered when the proxy is shut down or destroyed.
 *
 * The proxy can be safely shut down or destroyed even if the last discovery operation has not
 * finished yet.
