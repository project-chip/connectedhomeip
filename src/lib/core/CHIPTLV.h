/**
 * Provides a memory efficient parser for data encoded in CHIP TLV format.
 *
 * TLVReader implements a forward-only, “pull-style” parser for CHIP TLV data.  The TLVReader
 * object operates as a cursor that can be used to iterate over a sequence of TLV elements
 * and interpret their contents.  When positioned on an element, applications can make calls
 * to the reader's Get() methods to query the current element’s type and tag, and to extract
 * any associated value.  The reader’s Next() method is used to advance from element to element.
 *
 * A TLVReader object is always positioned either before, on or after a TLV element.  When first
 * initialized, a TLVReader is positioned immediately before the first element of the encoding.
 * To begin reading, an application must make an initial call to the Next() method to position
 * the reader on the first element.  When a container element is encountered--either a structure,
 * an array or a path--the OpenContainer() or EnterContainer() methods can be used to iterate
 * through the contents of the container.
 *
 * When the reader reaches the end of a TLV encoding, or the last element within a container,
 * it signals the application by returning a CHIP_END_OF_TLV error from the Next() method.
 * The reader will continue to return CHIP_END_OF_TLV until it is reinitialized, or the current
 * container is exited (via CloseContainer() / ExitContainer()).
 *
 * A TLVReader object can parse data directly from a fixed input buffer, or from memory provided
 * by a TLVBackingStore.

/**
 * Provides a unified Reader/Writer interface for editing/adding/deleting elements in TLV encoding.
 *
 * The TLVUpdater is a union of the TLVReader and TLVWriter objects and provides interface methods
 * for editing/deleting data in an encoding as well as adding new elements to the TLV encoding. The
 * TLVUpdater object essentially acts like two cursors, one for reading existing encoding and
 * another for writing (either for copying over existing data or writing new data).
 *
 * Semantically, the TLVUpdater object functions like a union of the TLVReader and TLVWriter. The
 * TLVUpdater methods have more or less similar meanings as similarly named counterparts in
 * TLVReader/TLVWriter. Where there are differences in the semantics, the differences are clearly
 * documented in the function's comment section in CHIPTLVUpdater.cpp.
 *
 * One particularly important note about the TLVUpdater's PutBytes() and PutString() methods is that
 * it can leave the encoding in a corrupt state with only the element header written when an
 * overflow occurs. Applications can call GetRemainingFreeLength() to make sure there is
 * @em approximately enough free space to write the encoding. Note that GetRemainingFreeLength()
 * only tells you the available free bytes and there is @em no way for the application to know the
 * length of encoded data that gets written. In the event of an overflow, both PutBytes() and
 * PutString() will return CHIP_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL to the caller.
 *
 * Also, note that Next() method is overloaded to both skip the current element and also advance the
 * internal reader to the next element. Because skipping already encoded elements requires changing
 * the internal writer's free space state variables to account for the new freed space (made
 * available by skipping), the application is expected to call Next() on the updater after a Get()
 * method whose value it doesn't wish to write back (which is equivalent to skipping the current
 * element).
 *
 * @note The application is expected to use the TLVUpdater object atomically from the time it calls
 * Init() till it calls Finalize(). The same buffer should NOT be used with other TLVWriter objects.
 *
 * @note The TLVUpdater currently only supports single static buffers. TLVBackingStore is NOT supported.
