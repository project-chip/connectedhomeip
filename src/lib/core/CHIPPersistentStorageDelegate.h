     * @brief
     *   This is a synchronous Get API, where the value is returned via the output
     *   buffer.
     *
     *   This API can be used to retrieve a byte buffer value from the storage.
     *   There is no implied data format and and data will be stored/fetched binary.
     *   Caller is responsible to take care of any special formatting needs (e.g. byte
     *   order, null terminators, consistency checks or versioning).
     *
     *
     * @param[in]      key Key to lookup
     * @param[out]     buffer Value for the key
     * @param[in, out] size Input value buffer size, output length of value.
     *                 The output length could be larger than input value. In
     *                 such cases, the user should allocate the buffer large
     *                 enough (>= output length), and call the API again.
     *
     * @return CHIP_ERROR_PERSISTED_STORAGE_VALUE_NOT_FOUND the key is unknown.
     * @return CHIP_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL the provided buffer is not big
     *                                     enough.  In this case "size" will
     *                                     indicate the needed buffer size.
     *                                     Some data may or may not be placed
     *                                     in "buffer" in this case; consumers
     *                                     should not rely on that behavior.
     *                                     CHIP_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL combined
     *                                     with setting "size" to 0 means the
     *                                     actual size was too large to fit in
