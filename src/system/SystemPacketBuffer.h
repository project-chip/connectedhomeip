/**    @class PacketBuffer
 *
 *     @brief
 *      The packet buffer class is the core structure used for manipulating packets of octet-serialized data, usually in the
 *      context of a data communications network, like Bluetooth or the Internet protocol.
 *
 *      In LwIP-based environments, this class is built on top of the pbuf structure defined in that library. In the absence of
 *      LwIP, chip provides either a malloc-based implementation, or a pool-based implementation that closely approximates the
 *      memory challenges of deeply embedded devices.
 *
 *      The PacketBuffer class, like many similar structures used in layered network stacks, provide a mechanism to reserve space
 *      for protocol headers at each layer of a configurable communication stack.  For details, see `PacketBuffer::New()` as well
 *      as LwIP documentation.
 *
 *      PacketBuffer objects are reference-counted, and normally held and used through a PacketBufferHandle that owns one of the
 *      counted references. When a PacketBufferHandle goes out of scope, its reference is released. To take ownership, a function
 *      takes a PacketBufferHandle by value. To borrow ownership, a function takes a `const PacketBufferHandle &`.
 *
 *      New objects of PacketBuffer class are initialized at the beginning of an allocation of memory obtained from the underlying
 *      environment, e.g. from LwIP pbuf target pools, from the standard C library heap, from an internal buffer pool. In the
 *      simple case, the size of the data buffer is #CHIP_SYSTEM_PACKETBUFFER_SIZE. A composer is provided that permits usage of
 *      data buffers of other sizes.
 *
 *      PacketBuffer objects may be chained to accomodate larger payloads.  Chaining, however, is not transparent, and users of the
 *      class must explicitly decide to support chaining.  Examples of classes written with chaining support are as follows:
 *
 *          @ref chip::chipTLVReader
 *          @ref chip::chipTLVWriter
 *
