/**
 * @class WatchableEventManager
 *
 * An instance of this type is contained in System::Layer. Its purpose is to hold socket-event system state
 * or methods available to every associated instance of WatchableSocket.
 *
 * It MUST provide at least three methods:
 *
 * - CHIP_ERROR Init(System::Layer & systemLayer) -- called from System::Layer::Init()
 * - CHIP_ERROR Shutdown()                        -- called from System::Layer::Shutdown()
 * - void Signal()                                -- called to indicate that event monitoring may need to be refreshed or resumed.
 *
 * Other contents depend on the contract between socket-event implementation and platform layer implementation.
 * For POSIX-like platforms, WatchableEventManager provides a set of functions called from the event loop:
 *
 * - void EventLoopBegins()  -- Called before the first iterations of the event loop.
 * - void PrepareEvents()    -- Called at the start of each iteration of the event loop.
 * - void WaitForEvents()    -- Called on each iteration of the event loop, between PrepareEvents() and HandleEvents().
 *                              Uniquely, this method gets called with the CHIP stack NOT locked, so it can block.
 *                              For example, the select()-based implementation calls select() here.
 * - void HandleEvents()     -- Called at the end of each iteration of the event loop.
 * - void EventLoopEnds()    -- Called after the last iteration of the event loop.
