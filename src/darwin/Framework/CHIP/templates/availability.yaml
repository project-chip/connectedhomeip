# The magic value "future" for versions can be used once we are
# tracking a release but don't know what its version numbers will be.
#
# Each release has:
# * A name (labeled "release")
# * A versions field which is either a dictionary of per-OS versions, or "future"
# * "introduced" and "deprecated" fields, which are dictionaries with the following keys:
#   * "clusters": An array of cluster names
#   * "attributes": A dictionary with cluster names as keys and arrays of
#                   attribute names as values.
#   * "commands": A dictionary with cluster names as keys and arrays of
#                 command names as values.
#   * "command fields": A dictionary with cluster names as keys and dictionaries
#                       as values.  Those dictionaries have command names as
#                       keys and arrays of field names as values.
#   * "structs": A dictionary with cluster names as keys and arrays of
#                struct names as values.
#   * "struct fields": A dictionary with cluster names as keys and dictionaries
#                      as values.  Those dictionaries have struct names as
#                      keys and arrays of field names as values.
#   * "events": A dictionary with cluster names as keys and arrays of
#               event names as values.
#   * "event fields": A dictionary with cluster names as keys and dictionaries
#                     as values.  Those dictionaries have event names as
#                     keys and arrays of field names as values.
#   * "enums": A dictionary with cluster names as keys and arrays of
#              enum names as values.
#   * "enum values": A dictionary with cluster names as keys and dictionaries
#                    as values.  Those dictionaries have enum names as
#                    keys and arrays of enum value names as values.
#   * "bitmaps": A dictionary with cluster names as keys and arrays of
#                bitmap names as values.
#   * "bitmap values": A dictionary with cluster names as keys and dictionaries
#                      as values.  Those dictionaries have bitmap names as
#                      keys and arrays of bitmap value names as values.
#   * "ids": Can contain clusters, attributes, commands, events as described
#            above inside it, but just indicates whether the id was
#            introduced/deprecated, not the construct itself.
#   * "command payloads": Lists commands only, if we introduced the payload without
#                         actually exposing API for the command.
#   * "global attributes": An array of names of global attributes.
#   * "apis": An array of API labels that codegen can use.
#
# * "renames": Can contain clusters, attributes, etc as described
#              above for "introduced" and "deprecated", with the one
#              difference that instead of an array the value is a hash
#              with new names as keys and old names as values.
#
# * "removed": Can contain clusters, commands, attributes, etc as described
#              above for "introduced" and "deprecated".  Items can be removed
#              without ever being introduced, if they are added to the XML but
#              we have never shipped generated APIs for them.
#              NOTE: support for "removed" may not be complete in the templates.
#              Please examine codegen carefully when using "removed" to make
#              sure all the things that should have been removed have been.
#
# * "swiftUnavailable": Can contain clusters, commands, attributes, etc as
#                       described above for "introduced" and "deprecated".  This
#                       can be used to mark APIs with NS_SWIFT_UNAVAILABLE,
#                       typically when an API was renamed between two names that
#                       map to the same Swift name and then both names were
#                       deprecated.
#
# * "provisional": Can contain clusters, commands, attributes, etc as described
#                  above for "introduced" and "deprecated".  Items can be
#                  defined as provisional to prevent code generation for them.
#                  If they are then listed as introduced in a release that is
#                  later than the one where they were marked provisional,
#                  they will start being code-generated.
#                  NOTE: support for "provisional" may not be complete in the
#                  templates. Please examine codegen carefully when using
#                  "provisional" to make sure all the things that should have
#                  been omitted have been.
