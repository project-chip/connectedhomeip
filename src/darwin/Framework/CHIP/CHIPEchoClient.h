/**
 *    @file
 *      This file implements describes a temporary helper class to implement an echo client for CHIP
 *      This may be removed from the framework soon.
 *
 *      Note: Do not use CHIPDeviceController directly if you use this class to initialize an EchoServer
 *
 *      Sample Usage:
 *        _echoClient = [[CHIPEchoClient alloc] initWithServerAddress:@"192.168.1.22" port:8000];
 *        if (_echoClient) {
 *            NSError * error;
 *            BOOL didStart = [_echoClient startWithFrequency:10 stopAfter:60 withError:&error];
 *            if (!didStart) {
 *                os_log(OS_LOG_DEFAULT, "Failed to start echo client %@", error);
 *            }
 *         }
