# Python CHIP Controller

The Python CHIP controller is a library that allows to create a Matter fabric
and commission Matter devices with it, as well as communicate with commissioned
devices by reading/subscribing and writing Attributes and sending Commands. The
Python CHIP controller is based on the native [Chip Device Controller](../)
library.

The Python CHIP Controller comes with a REPL which allows to explore and use the
Python CHIP controller library from a shell. To learn more about the Python CHIP
Controller and the REPL, how to build it and use its commands and advanced
features, read the following guides:
