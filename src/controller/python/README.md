# CHIP Device Controller - Python Binding & Command line interface

## Overview

Chip Device Controller is a general library to control devices and manage
commissioner functionality, it has Python, Java (for Android) and ObjC (for iOS)
bindings for building tests and CHIP mobile applications. This document will
focus on its python binding interface on Linux and mac os.

## Checkout / Build / Install

> Note: The CHIP can be built on Linux (amd64 / aarch64) and macOS

1. Clone Project CHIP repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip.git
```

2. Build CHIP

Follow [BUILDING.md](/docs/BUILDING.md) to build CHIP on your platform.

3. Install Chip Device Controller

> Note: Python device controller is not versioned, so you need to uninstall the
> old device controller before install the new one.

**For Linux (Raspberry Pi 4)**

```
cd out/debug/controller/python
sudo pip3 install chip-0.0-cp38-cp38-linux_aarch64.whl
```

> Note: for linux, sudo is necessary since it need to interact with bluetoothd
> via dbus with sudo permission

**For macOS**

```
cd out/debug/mac_x64_clang/controller/python
pip3 install chip-0.0-cp38-cp38-mac_aarch64.whl
```

## BLE Virtualization on Linux (Optional)

If we would like to setup virtual BLE central and peripheral in the same
machine, then Bluez setup

```
cd third_party/bluez/repo
./bootstrap
third_party/bluez/repo/configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var --enable-experimental --with-systemdsystemunitdir=/lib/systemd/system --with-systemduserunitdir=/usr/lib/systemd --enable-deprecated --enable-testing --enable-tools
make
```

Note: You also need to install several packages on RPi if you want to build
bluez

```
sudo apt-get install libtool m4 automake autotools-dev libudev-dev libical-dev libreadline-dev
```

Run bluetoothd:

```
sudo third_party/bluez/repo/src/bluetoothd --experimental --debug &
```

Bring up two virtual ble interface:

```
sudo third_party/bluez/repo/emulator/btvirt -L -l2
```

## Usage / BLE Secure Session Establishment

1. Run CHIP Device Controller

```
sudo chip-device-ctrl
```

2. [WIP][required when there are multiple ble adapters] Select BLE adapter
   (Linux only)

```
chip-device-ctrl > ble-adapter-print
2020-11-23 17:41:53,116 ChipBLEMgr   INFO     adapter 0 = DE:AD:BE:EF:00:00
2020-11-23 17:41:53,116 ChipBLEMgr   INFO     adapter 1 = DE:AD:BE:EF:01:01
2020-11-23 17:41:53,116 ChipBLEMgr   INFO     adapter 2 = DE:AD:BE:EF:02:02

chip-device-ctrl > ble-adapter-select DE:AD:BE:EF:00:00
```

3. Scan BLE devices

```
chip-device-ctrl > ble-scan
2021-01-19 02:27:23,653 ChipBLEMgr   INFO     scanning started

```

4.  Set wifi credential

> Note: This command will be deprerated after the network provisioning cluster
> is ready.

```
chip-device-ctrl > set-pairing-wifi-credential TestAP TestPassword
```

5.  Connect to device using setup pin code

```
chip-device-ctrl > connect -ble 1383 12345678
```

## IP Secure Session Establishment

1. Run CHIP Device Controller

```
chip-device-ctrl
```

> Note: SUDO is not required when use IP to connect device.

2. Connect to device using setup pin code

```
chip-device-ctrl > connect -ip <Device IP Address> 12345678
```
