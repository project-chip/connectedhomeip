class FabricAdmin:
    ''' Administers a given fabric instance. Each admin is associated with
        a specific RCAC and ICAC as well as Fabric ID and Index.

        There can only be one admin instance for a given fabric in a single
        Python process instance.

        The admin also persists to storage its detail automatically to permit
        easy loading of its information later.

        >> C++ Binding Details

        Each instance of the fabric admin is associated with a single instance
        of the OperationalCredentialsAdapter. This adapter instance implements
        the OperationalCredentialsDelegate and is meant to provide a Python 
        adapter to the functions in that delegate so that the fabric admin
        can in turn, provide users the ability to generate their own NOCs for devices
        on the network (not implemented yet). For now, it relies on the in-built 
        ExampleOperationalCredentialsIssuer to do that.

        TODO: Add support for FabricAdmin to permit callers to hook up their own GenerateNOC
              logic.

        >> Persistence

        Each instance persists its fabric ID and index to storage. This is in addition to the
        persistence built into the ExampleOperationalCredentialsIssuer that persists details
        about the RCAC/ICAC as well. This facilitates re-construction of a fabric admin on subsequent
        boot for a given fabric and ensuring it automatically picks up the right ICAC/RCAC details as well.
