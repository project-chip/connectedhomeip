# CHIP controller

There are currently 4 implementations of the CHIP device controller with varying
support for certain CHIP features.

## Implementations

### iOS

The iOS chip-tool is located in [../darwin/CHIPTool](../darwin/CHIPTool).

### Android

The Android chip-tool is located in [../android/CHIPTool](../android/CHIPTool).

### POSIX CLI

The POSIX CLI chip-tool is located in
[../../examples/chip-tool](../../examples/chip-tool).

### Python

The Python chip-device-ctrl is located in
[../controller/python/](../controller/python).

Notes:

(\*0) <https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/pull/4829>

(\*1) Only static commissioning, not MeshCoP.

(\*2) Locally a patch exists, could be upstreamed.

(\*3) Uses deprecated Chip Device Controller, move to new CHIP Device controller
WIP according to Slack conversation.
