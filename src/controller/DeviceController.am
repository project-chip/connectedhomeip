#    Description:
#      This file is the GNU automake header for the CHIP DeviceController
#      library sources.
#

# The ChipDeviceController is designed for use in client applications (e.g.
# mobiles) or within resource rich devices (typically linux based).  As
# such it depends on the presense of a generalized heap (malloc el al).
# In contexts where this isn't available, simply skip building the Device
# Controller code altogether.
