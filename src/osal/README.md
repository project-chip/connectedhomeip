# CHIP Operating System Abstraction Layer (OSAL)

# Introduction

The CHIP OSAL is designed to provide a thin adaptation layer for portability of
the example applications and common portions of the DeviceLayer to a range of
Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS). The intent is to leverage native OS
primitives as much as possible while providing a unified interface surface for
those primitives to the rest of the CHIP system, and to deliver common OS
functionality suitable for deeply embedded environments.

CHIP OSAL provides abstractions for:

-   tasks (aka threads)
-   mutex
-   semaphores
-   queues
-   timers
-   time

CHIP OSAL currently supports the above abstractions for the following OS
targets:

-   POSIX (pthread)

Implementations for the following targets are planned:

-   FreeRTOS
-   Zephyr
-   MacOS / Darwin - Adjustments to POSIX to support MacOS (mainly timer_t).

# Reference

## Task

A task is an independent context of code execution that runs without any
dependency on other concurrent tasks within the system. Only one task runs at
any given time. The scheduler starts and stops tasks as necessary to manage
resources according to the priorities and policies of the system. A task has no
knowledge of the underlying scheduler activity and can be swapped in and out,
but will always run with a consistent execution context and stack.

## Mutex

A mutex provides a locking mechanism for enforcing mutual exclusion and
protection of shared resources between independent paths of execution such as
different tasks or interrupts.

## Semaphore

A semaphore is a synchronization primitive which provides a means to block one
task until it is released by a signal from another task or interrupt.

## Queue

A queue is a basic primitive for intertask communication. A queue can be used to
send messages from a task or interrupt producer to a consumer task using copy
semantics.

## Timer

A timer triggers a callback function after a given amount of time has passed.

## Time

A collection of utility functions for getting current system time and converting
between milliseconds and CPU ticks is provided.

# Porting guide

The CHIP OSAL module is structured as follows:

| File / Folder           | Contents                                                            |
