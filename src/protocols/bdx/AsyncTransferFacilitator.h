/**
 * An abstract class with methods for handling BDX messages received from an ExchangeContext. Once a message is received, this
 * class passes the message to the TransferSession to process the received messages and calls ProcessOutputEvents to get the next
 * output events generated by the TransferSession state machine until it receives an output event of type TransferSession::OutputEventType::kNone.
 * For each output event it receives, it either sends a message accross the exchange if the TransferSession generated an event of
 * type TransferSession::OutputEventType::kMsgToSend or calls the HandleTransferSessionOutput method to notify the subclass of the output event
 * which has the business logic of handling the BDX message and calling the TransferSession API to proceed with the BDX transfer. For e.g.,
 * If this class received a ReceiveInit message and passed it to the HandleTransferSessionOutput method, the subclass would call the
 * AcceptTransfer on the TransferSession object to negotiate params and prepare a ReceiveAccept message.
 *
 * This class does not define any methods for beginning a transfer or initializing the underlying TransferSession object.
 * See AsyncResponder for a class that does.
 * TODO: # 29334 - Add AsyncInitiator to handle the initiating side of a transfer.
 *
 * An AsyncTransferFacilitator is associated with a specific BDX transfer.
