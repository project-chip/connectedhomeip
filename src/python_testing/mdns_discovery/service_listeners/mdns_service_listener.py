    A service listener used during mDNS service discovery.

    The listener registers with an `AsyncZeroconf` instance to receive
    service add/update events. When such an event occurs, the internal
    asyncio `Event` (`updated_event`) is set.

    The event is entirely internal â€” `wait_for_service_update()` is
    expected to await `updated_event.wait()` to detect when a service
    record update has been received.
