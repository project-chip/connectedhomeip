    [TC-CNET-4.10] [Thread] Verification for RemoveNetwork Command [DUT-Server]

    Pre-Conditions:
        1. DUT supports CNET.S.F01(TH).
        2. DUT has a Network Commissioning cluster on the endpoint specified
           in the --endpoint command-line argument, with a FeatureMap attribute of 2.
        3. DUT is commissioned on the operational network specified
           in the --thread-dataset-hex command-line argument.
        4. TH can communicate with the DUT on the commissioned network.

    Example usage: 
        To run the test case, use the following command:

        ```bash
        python src/python_testing/TC_CNET_4_10.py --commissioning-method ble-thread --discriminator 3840 --passcode 20202021 \ 
        --endpoint <endpoint_value> --thread-dataset-hex <dataset_value>
        ```

        Where `<endpoint_value>` should be replaced with the actual endpoint number 
        for the Network Commissioning cluster on the DUT, and
        `dataset_value` should be replaced with the operational dataset of the DUT in hexadecimal format. 
        The Extended PAN ID will be automatically extracted from the provided dataset.
