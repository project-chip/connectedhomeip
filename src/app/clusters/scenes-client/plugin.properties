# Description of the plugin.
description=Ember implementation of the Scenes client cluster.  The plugin is only intended to assist with debugging as the implemented callbacks simply parse responses from the Scenes server and print the results.  Prior to production, this plugin should be replaced with code that acts on the responses in an appropriate way.
