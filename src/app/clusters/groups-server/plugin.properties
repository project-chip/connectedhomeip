# Description of the plugin.
description=Ember implementation of Groups server cluster.  This plugin supports receiving commands to add, retrieve, or modify the APS multicast group membership. Each group requires a binding table entry, so the binding table should be large enough to accommodate groups as well as any other bindings created during normal operation.
