# Description of the plugin.
description=Ember implementation of reporting. Reports are asynchronous messages sent out when an ZCL attribute has changed. This plugin supports both requesting reports from another device and sending out attribute reports when the device has been configured to do so. If the application will receive reports from multiple sources, Ember recommends configuring it as a concentrator. Note: This plugin only supports the binding-based interpretation of reporting in which reports are sent to corresponding entries in the binding table. Either the node sending the reports, the node receiving the reports, or another third-party configuration device may create the binding table entry(s) on the reporting node. For more details, please refer to Zigbee Application Framework Developer Guide.

enableGroupBoundReports.name=Allow reports to send via group bindings (zigbee 3.0 mandatory behavior)
enableGroupBoundReports.description=This feature is enabled by default to satisfy zigbee 3.0 compliance. Network commissioners should handle reports over group bindings with caution as the frequency and number of reports over multicasts can stagnate the network. Multicasts are treated as broadcasts, which consume network bandwidth.
