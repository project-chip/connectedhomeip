# Description of the plugin.
description=Ember implementation of Basic server cluster.  This plugin implements the optional ResetToFactoryDefaults command, which allows any remote device in the network to reset the local device.  When the application receives this command, the plugin will reset attributes managed by the framework to their default values and then call a callback so that the application can perform any other necessary reset-related operations.  The command is disruptive and not required, so Ember recommends disabling this plugin for most production application.
