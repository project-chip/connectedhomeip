     * Creates an Instance object which wraps a resource monitoring cluster object and attaches the provided delegate.
     *
     * This overloaded constructor facilitates keeping existing code in (for instance)
     * `examples/placeholder/linux/resource-monitoring-delegates.cpp`. This constructor forwards to the primary constructor overload
     * and then calls SetDelegate() with the supplied delegate. The caller is responsible for ensuring that the delegate remains
     * valid for the lifetime of the cluster instance.
     *
     * @param delegate                         Pointer to a ResourceMonitoringDelegate that will be associated with this instance.
     *                                        The caller must ensure the delegate outlives the cluster instance.
     * @param aEndpointId                      The endpoint on which this cluster exists. This must match the zap configuration.
     * @param aClusterId                       The ID of the ResourceMonitoring aliased cluster to be instantiated.
     * @param aFeatureMap                      The feature map of the cluster (packed as a uint32_t).
     * @param aDegradationDirection            The degradation direction of the cluster.
     * @param resetConditionCommandSupported   Whether the ResetCondition command is supported by the cluster.
