# Generated code

## What is this?

This folder contains test generation code. In order to execute unit tests, there has to be some
generated layer somewhere, and this is it.
For a real application, in a real SDK case, contents of this directory are generated on the fly
by the generation tool, based on actual ZCL configuration.
