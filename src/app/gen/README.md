# Generated code

## What is this?

This folder contains test generation code. In order to execute unit tests, there
has to be some generated layer somewhere, and this is it. For a real
application, in a real SDK case, contents of this directory are generated on the
fly by the generation tool, based on actual ZCL configuration.
