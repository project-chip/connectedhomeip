# The sources in this directory are TIGHTLY coupled with code-generated data models
# as generally implemented by `src/app/util`
#
# Corresponding functions defined in attribute-storace.cpp/attribute-table.cpp must
# be available at link time for this model to use and constants heavily depend
# on `zap-generated/endpoint_config.h` (generally compile-time constants that
# are code generated)
#
# As a result, the files here are NOT a source_set or similar because they cannot
# be cleanly built as a stand-alone and instead have to be imported as part of
# a different data model or compilation unit.
