 * @class ReportScheduler
 *
 * @brief This class is responsible for scheduling Engine runs based on the reporting intervals of the ReadHandlers.
 *
 *
 * This class holds a pool of ReadHandlerNodes that are used to keep track of the minimum and maximum timestamps for a report to be
 * emitted based on the reporting intervals of the ReadHandlers associated with the node.
 *
 * The ReportScheduler also holds a TimerDelegate pointer that is used to start and cancel timers for the ReadHandlers depending
 * on the reporting logic of the Scheduler.
 *
 * It inherits the ReadHandler::Observer class to be notified of reportability changes in the ReadHandlers.
 * It inherits the ICDStateObserver class to allow the implementation to generate reports based on the changes in ICD devices state,
 * such as going from idle to active and vice-versa.
 *
 * @note The logic for how and when to schedule reports is implemented in the subclasses of ReportScheduler, such as
 * ReportSchedulerImpl and SyncronizedReportSchedulerImpl.

     * @class ReadHandlerNode
     *
     * @brief This class is in charge of determining when a ReadHandler is reportable depending on the monotonic timestamp of the
     * system and the intervals of the ReadHandler. It inherits the TimerContext class to allow it to be used as a context for a
     * TimerDelegate so the TimerDelegate can call the TimerFired method when the timer expires.
     *
     *  The Logic to determine if a ReadHandler is reportable at a precise timestamp is as follows:
     *  1: The ReadHandler is in the CanStartReporting state
     *  2: The minimal interval since last report has elapsed
     *  3: The maximal interval since last report has elapsed or the ReadHandler is dirty
     *  If the three conditions are met, the ReadHandler is reportable.
     *
     *  Additionnal flags have been provided for specific use cases:
     *
     *  CanbeSynced: Mechanism to allow the ReadHandler to emit a report if another readHandler is ReportableNow.
     *  This flag can substitute the maximal interval condition or the dirty condition. It is currently only used by the
     *  SynchronizedReportScheduler.
     *
     *  EngineRunScheduled: Mechanism to ensure that the reporting engine will see the ReadHandler as reportable if a timer fires.
     *  This flag can substitute the minimal interval condition or the maximal interval condition. The goal is to allow for
     *  reporting when timers fire earlier than the minimal timestamp du to mechanism such as NTP clock adjustments.
