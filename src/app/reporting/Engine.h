 *  @class Engine
 *
 *  @brief The reporting engine is responsible for generating reports to reader. It is able to find the intersection
 * between the path interest set of each reader with what has changed in the publisher data store and generate tailored
 * reports for each reader.
 *
 *         At its core, it  tries to gather and pack as much relevant attributes changes and/or events as possible into a report
 * message before sending that to the reader. It continues to do so until it has no more work to do.
