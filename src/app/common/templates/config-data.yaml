EnumsNotUsedAsTypeInXML:
    # List of enums that are not used as a type in XML. By adding an enum
    # to this list you prevent incorrectly assuming from code that you are
    # able to use kUnknownEnumValue safely. This happens for derived clusters
    # such as ModeBase where there are CommonTag, DerivedClusterTags, MfgTags.

CommandHandlerInterfaceOnlyClusters:
    # List of clusters that are implemented entirely with
    # CommandHandlerInterface and hence do not need generated command dispatch.
    # This uses asUpperCamelCase versions of the cluster name.
