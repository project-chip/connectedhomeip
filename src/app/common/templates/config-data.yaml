EnumsNotUsedAsTypeInXML:
    # List of enums that are not used as a type in XML. By adding an enum
    # to this list you prevent incorrectly assuming from code that you are
    # able to use kUnknownEnumValue safely. This happens for derived clusters
    # such as ModeBase where there are CommonTag, DerivedClusterTags, MfgTags.
