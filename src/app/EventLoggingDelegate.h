     *  @brief
     *    A function that supplies eventData element for the event logging subsystem.
     *
     *  Functions of this type are expected to provide the eventData
     *  element for the event logging subsystem. The functions of this
     *  type are called after the event subsystem has generated all
     *  required event metadata. The function is called with a
     *  chip::TLV::TLVWriter object into which it will emit a single TLV element
     *  tagged kTag_EventData; the value of that element MUST be a
     *  structure containing the event data. The event data itself must
     *  be structured using context tags.
     *
     *
     *  @param[inout] aWriter A reference to the chip::TLV::TLVWriter object to be
     *                         used for event data serialization.
     *
     *  @retval #CHIP_NO_ERROR  On success.
     *
     *  @retval other           An appropriate error signaling to the
     *                          caller that the serialization of event
     *                          data could not be completed. Errors from
     *                          calls to the aWriter should be propagated
     *                          without remapping. If the function
     *                          returns any type of error, the event
     *                          generation is aborted, and the event is not
     *                          written to the log.
