/**
 * @brief write an attribute, performing all the checks.
 *
 * This function will attempt to write the attribute value from
 * the provided pointer. This function will only check that the
 * attribute exists. If it does it will write the value into
 * the attribute table for the given attribute.
 *
 * This function will not check to see if the attribute is
 * writable since the read only / writable characteristic
 * of an attribute only pertains to external devices writing
 * over the air. Because this function is being called locally
 * it assumes that the device knows what it is doing and has permission
 * to perform the given operation.
 *
 * if true is passed in for overrideReadOnlyAndDataType then the data type is
 * not checked and the read-only flag is ignored. This mode is meant for
 * testing or setting the initial value of the attribute on the device.
 *
 * this returns:
 * - Status::UnsupportedEndpoint: if endpoint isn't supported by the device.
 * - Status::UnsupportedCluster: if cluster isn't supported on the endpoint.
 * - Status::UnsupportedAttribute: if attribute isn't supported in the cluster.
 * - Status::InvalidDataType: if the data type passed in doesnt match the type
 *           stored in the attribute table
 * - Status::UnsupportedWrite: if the attribute isnt writable
 * - Status::ConstraintError: if the value is set out of the allowable range for
 *           the attribute
 * - Status::Success: if the attribute was found and successfully written
