/** @brief Allow Network Write Attribute
 *
 * This function is called by the application framework before it writes an
 * attribute in response to a write attribute request from an external device.
 * The value passed into this callback is the value to which the attribute is to
 * be set by the framework.
        Example:	In mirroring simple metering data
 * on an Energy Services Interface (ESI) (formerly called Energy Service Portal
 * (ESP) in SE 1.0).), a mirrored simple meter needs to write read-only
 * attributes on its mirror. The-meter-mirror sample application, located in
 * app/framework/sample-apps, uses this callback to allow the mirrored device to
 * write simple metering attributes on the mirror regardless of the fact that
 * most simple metering attributes are defined as read-only by the ZigBee
 * specification.
        Note:	The ZCL specification does not (as of this
 * writing) specify any permission-level security for writing writeable
 * attributes. As far as the ZCL specification is concerned, if an attribute is
 * writeable, any device that has a link key for the device should be able to
 * write that attribute. Furthermore if an attribute is read only, it should not
 * be written over the air. Thus, if you implement permissions for writing
 * attributes as a feature, you MAY be operating outside the specification. This
 * is unlikely to be a problem for writing read-only attributes, but it may be a
 * problem for attributes that are writeable according to the specification but
 * restricted by the application implementing this callback.

/** @brief External Attribute Write
 *
 * This function is called whenever the Application Framework needs to write an
 * attribute which is not stored within the data structures of the Application
 * Framework itself. One of the new features in Version 2 is the ability to
 * store attributes outside the Framework. This is particularly useful for
 * attributes that do not need to be stored because they can be read off the
 * hardware when they are needed, or are stored in some central location used by
 * many modules within the system. In this case, you can indicate that the
 * attribute is stored externally. When the framework needs to write an external
 * attribute, it makes a call to this callback.
        This callback is very
 * useful for host micros which need to store attributes in persistent memory.
 * Because each host micro (used with an Ember NCP) has its own type of
 * persistent memory storage, the Application Framework does not include the
 * ability to mark attributes as stored in flash the way that it does for Ember
 * SoCs like the EM35x. On a host micro, any attributes that need to be stored
 * in persistent memory should be marked as external and accessed through the
 * external read and write callbacks. Any host code associated with the
 * persistent storage should be implemented within this callback.
        All of
 * the important information about the attribute itself is passed as a pointer
 * to an EmberAfAttributeMetadata struct, which is stored within the application
 * and used to manage the attribute. A complete description of the
 * EmberAfAttributeMetadata struct is provided in
 * app/framework/include/af-types.h.
        This function assumes that the
 * application is able to write the attribute and return immediately. Any
 * attributes that require a state machine for reading and writing are not
 * candidates for externalization at the present time. The Application Framework
 * does not currently include a state machine for reading or writing attributes
 * that must take place across a series of application ticks. Attributes that
 * cannot be written immediately should be stored within the Application
 * Framework and updated occasionally by the application code from within the
 * emberAfMainTickCallback.
        If the application was successfully able to
 * write the attribute, it returns a value of EMBER_ZCL_STATUS_SUCCESS. Any
 * other return value indicates the application was not able to write the
 * attribute.

/** @brief External Attribute Read
 *
 * Like emberAfExternalAttributeWriteCallback above, this function is called
 * when the framework needs to read an attribute that is not stored within the
 * Application Framework's data structures.
        All of the important
 * information about the attribute itself is passed as a pointer to an
 * EmberAfAttributeMetadata struct, which is stored within the application and
 * used to manage the attribute. A complete description of the
 * EmberAfAttributeMetadata struct is provided in
 * app/framework/include/af-types.h
        This function assumes that the
 * application is able to read the attribute, write it into the passed buffer,
 * and return immediately. Any attributes that require a state machine for
 * reading and writing are not really candidates for externalization at the
 * present time. The Application Framework does not currently include a state
 * machine for reading or writing attributes that must take place across a
 * series of application ticks. Attributes that cannot be read in a timely
 * manner should be stored within the Application Framework and updated
 * occasionally by the application code from within the
 * emberAfMainTickCallback.
        If the application was successfully able to
 * read the attribute and write it into the passed buffer, it should return a
 * value of EMBER_ZCL_STATUS_SUCCESS. Ensure that the size of the externally
 * managed attribute value is smaller than what the buffer can hold. In the case
 * of a buffer overflow throw an appropriate error such as
 * EMBER_ZCL_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_SPACE. Any other return value indicates the
 * application was not able to read the attribute.
