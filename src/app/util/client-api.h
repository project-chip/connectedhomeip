/**
 * @brief Function that fills in the buffer with command.
 *
 * Fills the outgoing ZCL buffer and returns the number
 * of bytes used in a buffer. Uses the buffers that
 * were previously set with emberAfSetExternalBuffer.
 *
 * @param frameControl Byte used for frame control.
 * @param clusterId Cluster ID of message.
 * @param commandId Command ID of message.
 * @param format String format for further arguments to the function.
 *   Format values are:
 *     - '0' - '9' and 'A' - 'G': Pointer to a buffer containing 0--16 raw
 *            bytes.  The data is copied as is to the destination buffer.
 *     - 'u': uint8_t.
 *     - 'v': uint16_t. The bytes are copied in little-endian format to the
 *            destination buffer.
 *     - 'x': int24u. The bytes are copied in little-endian format to the
 *            destination buffer.
 *     - 'w': uint32_t. The bytes are copied in little-endian format to the
 *            destination buffer.
 *     - 'l': Pointer to a buffer containing a ZigBee long string, with the
 *            first two bytes of the buffer specifying the length of the string
 *            data in little-endian format. The length bytes and the string
 *            itself are both included as is in the destination buffer.
 *     - 's': Pointer to a buffer containing a ZigBee string, with the first
 *            byte of the buffer specifying the length of the string data. The
 *            length byte and the string itself are both included as is in the
 *            destination buffer.
 *     - 'L': Pointer to a buffer containing a long string followed by an
 *            uint16_t specifying the length of the string data. The length
 *            bytes in little-endian format will precede the string itself in
 *            the destination buffer.
 *     - 'S': Pointer to a buffer containing a string followed by an uint8_t
 *            specifying the length of the string data. The length byte will
 *            precede the string itself in the destination buffer.
 *     - 'b': Pointer to a buffer containing a sequence of raw bytes followed
 *            by an uint16_t specifying the length of the data. The data is
 *            copied as is to the destination buffer. The length is not
