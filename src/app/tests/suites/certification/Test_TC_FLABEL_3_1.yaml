name: 98.3.1. [TC-FLABEL-3.1] Fixed Label cluster [DUT-client]

PICS:
    - FLABEL.C

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: "Note"
      verification: |
          Chip-tool command used below are an example to verify the  DUT as client test cases. For certification test, we expect DUT should have a capability or way to run the equivalent command.
      disabled: true

    - label: "DUT reads LabelList from the TH"
      PICS: FLABEL.C.A0000

          Product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command on the DUT. For comparison, the DUT behavior for this test step can be simulated using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissioner/Client)

          ./chip-tool fixedlabel read label-list 1 0
          Verify DUT receives LabelList attribute response on the TH(all-clusters-app) Log:
