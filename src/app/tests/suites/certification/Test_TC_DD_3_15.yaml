          Preconditions
          1 - DUT is on an operational network and has accurate date, time, timezone, regulatory, and fabric information available.

          2 - 5.1.4.2 - Manual Pairing Code is printed on the Commissionee device or in additional provided materials (ex: manual).

          An example onboarding payload could be "34970112332" (11-digit) or could be "749701123365521327694" (21-digit) (following 5.1.4. Table 37. "Manual Pairing Code Elements") which each include:

          - 1-bit VID_PID_PRESENT = 0 (11-digit) or = 1 (21-digit)

          - 1-bit VERSION=0

          - 4-bit SHORT DISCRIMINATOR=0xF00 (4 Most-significant bits of the 12-bits Discriminator value)

          - 27-bit PASSCODE=20202021 (see section 5.1.6. Generation of the Passcode)

          - 16-bit VENDOR_ID=0xFFF1 (as defined in section 2.5.2. "Vendor Identifier", for 21-digit Manual Pairing Code only)

          - 16-bit PRODUCT_ID=0x8001 (as defined in section 2.5.3. "Product Identifier", present if and only if VID is present)

          - A generated CHECK_DIGIT (see section 5.1.4. Manual Pairing Code, subsection "Check Digit")
