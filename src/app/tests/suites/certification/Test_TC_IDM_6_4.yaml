          Provision DUT and TH.

          To generate the software fault event, execute the following
          1. Get the PID of the DUT & KIll it .
                      ps  -aef|grep all-clusters-app
                      sudo kill -SIGUSR1 <PID of DUT>

          After killing the DUT , you may observe the following log in the DUT
