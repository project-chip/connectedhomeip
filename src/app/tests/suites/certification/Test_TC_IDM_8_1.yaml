          attribute, which is a fabric scoped list, from the DUT. Fabric

          Verify that the number of entries returned by the DUT for both the reads are same. Verify that the response to RC1 does not contain fabric sensitive data belonging to the other fabric. The fabric sensitive fields in the entries belonging to the other fabric should either be null or contain default values. Verify that the response to RC2 does not contain fabric sensitive data belonging to the other fabric. The fabric sensitive fields in the entries belonging to the other fabric should either be null or contain default values.

          Verify that the data received from DUT after the second read request from RC2 is same as the data received after the first read request from RC2. Verify that the data received from the DUT after the second read request from RC1 has the correct modifications to the data.
