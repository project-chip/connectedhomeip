          Product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command on the DUT. For comparison, the DUT behavior for this test step can be simulated using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissioner) or tv-casting-app (when DUT is a commissionee):

          ./chip-tool applicationlauncher stop-app "{"catalogVendorId": 123, "applicationId": "exampleid"}" 1 1
          ./chip-tv-casting-app applicationlauncher stop-app "{"catalogVendorId": 123, "applicationId": "exampleid"}" 1 1


          The log below shows the resulting log on the TH (tv-app or all-clusters-app):
