          Commission TH to DUT, if not done so already. In some cases, such as with a Casting Video Player, the TH commissions the DUT.

          Product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command on the DUT. For comparison, the DUT behavior for this test step can be simulated using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissioner) or tv-casting-app (when DUT is a commissionee):

          ./chip-tool applicationlauncher stop-app "{"catalogVendorId": 123, "applicationId": "exampleid"}" 1 1
          ./chip-tv-casting-app applicationlauncher stop-app "{"catalogVendorId": 123, "applicationId": "exampleid"}" 1 1


          The log below shows the resulting log on the TH (tv-app or all-clusters-app):
