    ### Step 1x -> Initialize Position
    ### MANDATORY Command
    - label: "1a: TH adjusts the the DUT to a non-closed position"
      command: "UpOrOpen"

    ### Depends on the FeatureMap
    - label:
          "1b: If (PA & LF) TH reads CurrentPositionLiftPercent100ths attribute
          from DUT"
      disabled: true # Step applied conditionnally with an !expected response value
      command: "readAttribute"
      attribute: "CurrentPositionLiftPercent100ths"
