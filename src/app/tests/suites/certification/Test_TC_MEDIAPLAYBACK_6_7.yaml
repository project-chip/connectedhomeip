    - label: "DUT sends SkipBackward command to TH"
      PICS: MEDIAPLAYBACK.C.C09.Tx
      verification: |
          Product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command on the DUT. For comparison, the DUT behavior for this test step can be simulated using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissioner) or tv-casting-app (when DUT is a commissionee):

          ./chip-tool mediaplayback skip-backward 10000 1 3
          ./chip-tv-casting-app mediaplayback skip-backward 10000 1 3


          The log below shows the resulting log on the TH (tv-app or all-clusters-app):
