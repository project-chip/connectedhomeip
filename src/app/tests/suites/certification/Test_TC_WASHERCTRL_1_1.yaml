      verification: |
          ./chip-tool laundrywashercontrols read cluster-revision 1 1

          On TH(Chip-tool) Verify the cluster-revision value is 1

    - label: "Step 3: TH reads from the DUT the FeatureMap attribute"
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool laundrywashercontrols read feature-map 1 1

          On TH(chip-tool), verify that DUT sends  FeatureMap attribute
          Below is the example value which is observed in the RPI platform the value may be differ based on the dut implementation.
      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 4: TH reads from the DUT the AttributeList attribute"
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool laundrywashercontrols read attribute-list 1 1

          Verify we are getting supported attribute list sent in the above command on TH(chip-tool) log
          Below is the example value which is observed in the RPI platform the value may be differ based on the dut implementation.

    - label: "Step 6: TH reads from the DUT the AcceptedCommandList attribute"
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool laundrywashercontrols read accepted-command-list 1 1

          ON TH(Chip-tool) verify the Accepted-command-list value is 0 entries
