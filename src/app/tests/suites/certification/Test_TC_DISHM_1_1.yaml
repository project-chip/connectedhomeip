name: 263.1.1. [TC-DISHM-1.1] Global attributes with DUT as Server

PICS:
    - DISHM.S

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic Information"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label:
          "Step 1: Commission DUT to TH (can be skipped if done in a preceding
          test)."

    - label: "Step 2: TH reads from the DUT the ClusterRevision attribute."
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool dishwashermodeselect read cluster-revision 1 1

          Verify the "ClusterRevision" value is of unit16 and reflects the highest revision number 2 on the TH(chip-tool) and below is the sample log provided for the raspi platform:

    - label: "Step 3: TH reads from the DUT the FeatureMap attribute."
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool dishwashermodeselect read feature-map 1 1

          On the TH(chip-tool) Log, Verify featureMap value is 1, This value changes depending on DUT implementing the features and below is the sample log provided for the raspi platform:

      verification: |
          ./chip-tool dishwashermodeselect read attribute-list 1 1

          Verify the "AttributeList " should include the mandatory attributes (values 0, 2, 3),
          global attributes (value 65533, 65532, 65531, 65530, 65529 and 65528) and
          list may include optional attribute(value 0x0004), if MOD.S.A0004(StartUpMode) supports,
          list contains feature dependent attribute (values 0x0005), if MOD.S.F00(DEPONOFF) is true on the TH(chip-tool) Log and below is the sample log provided for the raspi platform:
