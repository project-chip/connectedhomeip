name: 19.9.3. [TC-AUDIOOUTPUT-7.3] Select Output Verification (DUT as Client)

PICS:
    - AUDIOOUTPUT.C

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic Information"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: "Preconditions:"
      verification: |
          Commission TH to DUT, if not done so already. In some cases, such as with a Casting Video Player, the TH commissions the DUT.
      disabled: true

          Product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command on the DUT. For comparison, the DUT behavior for this test step can be simulated using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissioner) or tv-casting-app (when DUT is a commissionee):

          ./chip-tool audiooutput select-output 1 1 1
          ./chip-tv-casting-app audiooutput select-output 1 1 1


          The log below shows the resulting log on the TH (tv-app or all-clusters-app):
