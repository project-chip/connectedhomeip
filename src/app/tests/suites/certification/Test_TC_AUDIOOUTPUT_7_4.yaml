name: 19.9.4. [TC-AUDIOOUTPUT-7.4] Rename Output Verification (DUT as Client)

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: "DUT sends RenameOutput command to TH"
      PICS: AUDIOOUTPUT.S.C0001
      verification: |
          If the DUT knows the Index value, then those can be sent as the argument.
          Else User needs to execute the following command to know the index InputList

          ./chip-tool audiooutput read output-list 1 1

          ./chip-tool audiooutput rename-output 1 'Kitchen Speakers' 1 1
          The following chip-tool command simulates the interaction of the DUT and the log below shows the resulting log on the TH.
