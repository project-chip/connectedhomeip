    3.6.1. [TC-SU-2.5] Tests the different scenarios on the DUT based on the
    ApplyUpdateResponse response sent by the OTA-P

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic"
    endpoint: 0

          field is set to 'Proceed' DelayedActionTime is set to 0."
      verification: |
          Verify that the DUT starts updating its software.
          Once the update is finished verify the software version on the DUT to match the version downloaded for the software update.

          ./chip-tool basic read software-version-string 0x1234567890 0

          Verify on the OTA-P/TH that there is no other ApplyUpdateRequest from the DUT.

          Run the OTA Provider App using the command:
          chip-ota-provider-app --discriminator 22 --secured-device-port 5565 --KVS /tmp/chip_kvs_provider --filepath /tmp/test.bin -p 180

          Verify that the DUT starts updating its software after 3 minutes. Once the update is finished verify the software version on the DUT to match the version downloaded for the software update.

          Verify that the DUT waits for the minimum interval defined by spec which is 2 minutes before re-sending the ApplyUpdateRequest to the OTA-P.
          Verify that the DUT does not apply the software update within this time.

          Verify that the DUT waits for 3 minutes before sending the ApplyUpdateRequest to the OTA-P.
          Verify that the DUT starts updating its software after the second ApplyUpdateResponse with Proceed action.
          Once the update is finished, verify the software version from the Basic Information cluster on the DUT to match the version downloaded for the software update.

          Verify that the DUT clears its previously downloaded software image and resets the UpdateState Attribute to Idle (Value 1)
          chip-tool otasoftwareupdaterequestor read update-state 0x1234567890 0

          Verify that the DUT does not send the NotifyUpdateApplied within a reasonable time.
          Verify the software version from the Basic Information cluster of the DUT to be the same as it was previously.
