    31.6.1. [TC-SU-2.5] Tests the different scenarios on the DUT based on the
    ApplyUpdateResponse response sent by the OTA-P

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label:
          "OTA-P/TH sends the ApplyUpdateResponse Command to the DUT. Action
          field is set to 'Proceed' DelayedActionTime is set to 0."
      verification: |
          Verify that the DUT starts updating its software.
          Once the update is finished verify the software version on the DUT to match the version downloaded for the software update.
          Verify on the OTA-P/TH that there is no other ApplyUpdateRequest from the DUT.

          Run the OTA Provider App using the command:
          ./chip-ota-provider-app -f sw_image.txt -t 300

          Verify that the DUT starts updating its software after 5 minutes. Once the update is finished verify the software version on the DUT to match the version downloaded for the software update.
