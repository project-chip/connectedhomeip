    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: "Note"
      verification: |
          Chip-tool command used below are an example to verify the  DUT as commissioner test cases. For certification test, we expect DUT should have a capability or way to run the equivalent command
      disabled: true

    - label:
          "By any means, TH adds an unknown key/value pair in the advertised
          data(e.g. AB=12345) and is in Commissioning Mode"
      verification: |
          Run all cluster app in one TH Terminal

          Run the  unknown key/value pair on second TH Terminal with the same discriminator as the one in the first teminal:

          avahi-publish-service --subtype=_S3._sub._matterc._udp --subtype=_L840._sub._matterc._udp DD200C20D25AE5F7 --subtype=_CM._sub._matterc._udp _matterc._udp 11111 D=3840 CM=1  INVALID_TEST=40 SII=5000 SAI=300 PH=36 PI= VP=65521+3276 T=1
          Established under name "DD200C20D25AE5F7"
      disabled: true

    - label: "DUT attempts to commission TH"
      verification: |
          Verify the DUT is able to commission the TH, in spite of the avahi publish with unknown key/value pair.
          As an example, In the case of chip-tool as commissioner, you can verify commissioning DUT with the below command, (Use the equivalent command on the DUT)
