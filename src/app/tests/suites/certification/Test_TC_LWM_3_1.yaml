name: 183.3.1. [TC-LWM-3.1] On Mode functionality with DUT as Server

PICS:
    - LWM.S

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic Information"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label:
          "Step 1: Commission DUT to TH (can be skipped if done in a preceding
          test)."
      verification: |

      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 2: TH reads from the DUT the OnMode attribute."
      PICS: LWM.S.A0003 && LWM.S.F00
      verification: |
          Verify that the DUT response contains an integer value

          Save the value as on_mode_dut
      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 3: TH reads from the DUT the CurrentMode attribute."
      PICS: LWM.S.A0001 && LWM.S.F00
      verification: |
          Verify that the DUT response contains an integer value

          Save the value as old_current_mode_dut

          If on_mode_dut is equal to old_current_mode_dut proceed to step 4. Else proceed to step 6.

      PICS: LWM.S.A0000 && LWM.S.F00
      verification: |
          Verify that the DUT response contains a list of ModeOptionsStruct entries

          Verify that the list has two or more entries

          Save the Mode field values as supported_modes_dut

          Select a value from supported_modes_dut different from on_mode_dut. Save the value as new_mode_th.
