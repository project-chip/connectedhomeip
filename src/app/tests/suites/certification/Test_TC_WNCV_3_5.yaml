name: Window Covering [TC-WNCV-3.5] DownOrClose Long-Run Verification with server as DUT

# TODO: WindowCovering tests TC-WNCV-3.5 finalize featuremap conditional dependencies

config:
    cluster: "Window Covering"
    endpoint: 1


tests:
    ################ Position Init Phase #############
    ### Step 1x -> Initialize the Covering position before any testing
    ### MANDATORY Init Commands
    - label: "1a: TH sends UpOrOpen command to preposition the DUT in the opposite direction"
      command: "UpOrOpen"

    ### DUT adjusts to a non-closed position
    - label: "1b: TH Waits for 10 seconds movement(s) on the device"
      cluster: "DelayCommands"
      command: "WaitForMs"
      arguments:
          values:
              - name: "ms"
                value: 10000

    ######## DownOrClose Long-Run Command #######
    ### Step 2x -> Check DownOrClose Long-Run effects
    ### MANDATORY Command
    - label: "2a: TH sends DownOrClose command to DUT"
      command: "DownOrClose"

    ### DUT move toward its fully-closed position
    ### WARNING -> TIMEOUT Cannot be set here yet we while rely on report
    ### Timeout might need to be given from the CLI via an extra arguments
    - label: "2b: TH set a timeout of 5-10 minutes for failure"
      cluster: "DelayCommands"
      command: "WaitForMs"
      arguments:
          values:
              - name: "ms"
                value: 1000

    ### Reports for END OF MOVEMENTs
    ### Step 2x ->  This report check behave like a DO WHILE waiting for the end of the movements
    - label: "2c: Verify DUT reports OperationalStatus attribute to TH after a DownOrClose"
      command: "subscribeAttribute"
      attribute: "OperationalStatus"
      minInterval: 10
      maxInterval: 60
      response:
          constraints:
              type: map8
              value: 0

    ######## DownOrClose Long-Run: Category only for Position Aware DUT #######
    ### Step 3x -> Verify the DUT has reached its fully-closed limits
    ### Optional Depends on the FeatureMap
    - label:
          "3a: If (PA & LF) TH reads CurrentPositionLiftPercent100ths attribute
          from DUT"
      command: "readAttribute"
      attribute: "CurrentPositionLiftPercent100ths"
      response:
          constraints:
              type: uint16
              value: 10000

    ### Optional Depends on the FeatureMap
    - label:
          "3b: If (PA & LF) TH reads CurrentPositionLiftPercentage
           optional attribute from DUT"
      command: "readAttribute"
      attribute: "CurrentPositionLiftPercentage"
      response:
          constraints:
              type: uint8
              value: 100

    ### Mandatory Depends on the FeatureMap
    - label:
          "3c: If (PA & TL) TH reads CurrentPositionTiltPercent100ths attribute
          from DUT"
      command: "readAttribute"
      attribute: "CurrentPositionTiltPercent100ths"
      response:
          constraints:
          constraints:
              type: uint16
              value: 10000

    ### Optional Depends on the FeatureMap
    - label:
          "3d: If (PA & LF) TH reads CurrentPositionTiltPercentage
           optional attribute from DUT"
      command: "readAttribute"
      attribute: "CurrentPositionTiltPercentage"
      response:
          constraints:
              type: uint8
              value: 100
