name: 3.3.23 [TC-DD-3.23] NFC-based commissioning [DUT as Commissionee]

PICS:
    - MCORE.ROLE.COMMISSIONER
    - MCORE.DD.NFC
    - MCORE.DD.NTL

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic Information"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: |
        Step 1: If needed, activate tag detection in TH NFC reader,
        and bring in TH NFC reader close to the DUT’s NFC tag
        (the order is not relevant).
      verfication: |
        The tag is detected, the onboarding payload is read.
      disabled: true

    - label: |
        Step 2:
        If "Custom Flow" field of Onboarding data corresponds to "User-Intent commissioning flow",
        perform user action required to enter commissioning mode.
      verification: |
        Commissioning mode is activated (will be verified in following steps).
      disabled: true

    - label: |
        Step 3:
        If "Custom Flow" field of Onboarding data corresponds to "Custom commissioning flow",
        perform vendor-specified interactions to enter commissioning mode.
      verification: |
        Commissioning mode is activated (will be verified in following steps)
      disabled: true

    - label: |
        Step 4:
        Bring or keep TH NFC reader close to the DUT’s NFC tag,
        and initiate commissioning through NFC interface (NTL).
      verification: |
        1. No error reported by Commissioner.
        2. Commissioner reports either a commissioning successfully done,
        or a message requesting to power-on the DUT
      disabled: true
#    - label: "Step 4: Initiate commissioning through NFC interface (NTL) using
#        NodeId and Onboarding payload on command-line"
#      command: "PairWithCodeThruNFC"
#      arguments:
#          values:
#              - name: "nodeId"
#                value: nodeId
#              - name: "payload"
#                value: payload

    - label: |
        Step 5:
        If needed (according to Commissioner, or because not already done),
        power-on the DUT
        to initiate the 2nd phase of commissioning through operational network.
      verification: |
        No error reported by Commissioner.
        Commissioner reports a commissioning successfully done,
      disabled: true
