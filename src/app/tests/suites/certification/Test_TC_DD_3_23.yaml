name: 3.3.23 [TC-DD-3.23] NFC-based commissioning [DUT as Commissionee]

PICS:
    - MCORE.ROLE.COMMISSIONEE
    - MCORE.DD.NFC
    - MCORE.DD.NTL

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic Information"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: |
          Step 1: Bring the NFC reader close to the DUTâ€™s NFC tag.
      disabled: true

    - label: |
          Step 2:
          If "Custom Flow" field of Onboarding data corresponds to "User-Intent commissioning flow",
          perform user action required to enter commissioning mode.
      disabled: true

    - label: |
          Step 3:
          If "Custom Flow" field of Onboarding data corresponds to "Custom commissioning flow",
          perform vendor-specified interactions to enter commissioning mode.
      disabled: true

    - label: |
          Step 4: Start Thread Border Router and perform NFC-based commissioning.

      verification: |
          # Start the Thread Border Router with:
          ./certification-tool/backend/test_collections/matter/scripts/OTBR/otbr_start.sh

          # Copy the Thread dataset that is displayed on the line starting with "Param: 'dataset active -x'"

          # Launch NFC-based commissioning with chip-tool (replace XXXXXXX by the Thread dataset)
          ./apps/chip-tool pairing nfc-thread 1 hex:XXXXXXX 20202021 3840

          Expected result:
          - chip-tool should complete without error
          - The traces should show that commissioning completed successfully.
      disabled: true

    - label: |
          Step 5: Stop the Thread Border Router
      verification: |
          # Stop the Thread Border Router with:
          ./certification-tool/backend/test_collections/matter/scripts/OTBR/otbr_stop.sh
      disabled: true
