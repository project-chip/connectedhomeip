          Product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command on the DUT. For comparison, the DUT behavior for this test step can be simulated using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissioner) or tv-casting-app (when DUT is a commissionee):

          ./chip-tool mediaplayback  play 1 3
          ./chip-tv-casting-app mediaplayback  play 1 3

          On TH (tv-app), Verify the play command is received successfully.
