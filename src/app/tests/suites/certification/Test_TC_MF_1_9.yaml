    22.1.9. [TC-MF-1.9] Device exit commissioning mode after 20 failed
    commission attempts [ECM] [DUT - Commissionee]

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: "TH_CR1 starts a commissioning process with DUT_CE"
      verification: |
          1. Provision the device using 1st python controller on the raspi (use above instructions)
      disabled: true

    - label:
          "TH_CR1 opens a commissioning window on DUT_CE using a commissioning
          timeout of PIXIT_COMM_WIN seconds using ECM"
      verification: |
          On 1st controller, using chip-tool, send the open-commissioning-window CMD for ECM. -t stands for timeout value, -o for OriginalSetupCode/TokenWithRandomPIN/TokenWithProvidedPIN , -d for descriminator -i for iteration count. Ref to cmd help.

          The setup pin code is extracted from the manual pairing code in the log and that will be used when pairing the 2nd admin controller.
