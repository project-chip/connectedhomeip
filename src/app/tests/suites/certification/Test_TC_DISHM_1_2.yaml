          ./chip-tool dishwashermode read supported-modes 1 1

          Verify that the DUT response contains list of ModeOptionsStruct entries.
          - Verify that list should contain at least one entry
          - Verify that each ModeOptionsStruct entry has a unique Mode field value and Label field value
          -  ModeOptionsStruct entryâ€™s ModeTags field is not empty,  then Verify the values of the Value fields that are not larger than 16 bits, for each Value field: Is the semantic tag value a defined common tag value (Auto(0x0000), Quick(0x0001), Quiet(0x0002), LowNoise(0x0003), LowEnergy(0x0004), Vacation(0x0005), Min(0x0006), Max(0x0007), Night(0x0008), Day(0x0009)) or a defined cluster alias tag value (RapidCool, RapidFreeze) or in the MfgTags (0x8000 to 0xBFFF) range
          - If the Value field is in the MfgTags (0x8000 to 0xBFFF) range, the TagName field is a string with a length between 1 and 64
          - Verify that at least one ModeOptionsStruct entry includes either the RapidCool semantic tag or the RapidFreeze semantic tag in the SemanticTags field
          - Save the Mode field values as supported_modes_dut on the TH (Chip-tool) and below is the sample log provided for the raspi platform:
