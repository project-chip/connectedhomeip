          2. when this attribute is false, do not need to verify rest of the below commands.
          3. When this attribute is true, the Node has been configured with one or more test event triggers by virtue of the internally programmed EnableKey value by the product vendor
          4. Use the manufacturer-provided EnableKey value and the EventTrigger value and send command using './chip-tool generaldiagnostics test-event-trigger <EnableKey> <EventTrigger destination-id> ' 1 0 and verify if the DUT generated the desired event.
