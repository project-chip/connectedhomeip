          Product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command on the DUT. For comparison, the DUT behavior for this test step can be simulated using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissioner) or tv-casting-app (when DUT is a commissionee):

          If the DUT knows the MajorNumber and MinorNumber in channel InputList then those can be sent as the argument. Else User needs to execute the following command to know the MajorNumber and MinorNumber to change the channel

           ./chip-tool channel read channel-list 1 1

          By sending above command user can select the MajorNumber and MinorNumber instead of 9 1 which are listed in chanel list.

          ./chip-tool channel change-channel-by-number 9  1 1 1
          ./chip-tv-casting-app channel change-channel-by-number 9 1 1 1


          The log below shows the resulting log on the TH (tv-app or all-clusters-app):
