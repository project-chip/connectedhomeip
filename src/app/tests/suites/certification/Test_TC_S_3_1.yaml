          a manufacturer specific order"
      verification: |
          - TH receives the read command and knows this attribute for this cluster and provides a plausible value. - DUT processes the values and operates normally (does not crash, continues with next steps)

      verification: |
          - TH receives the read command, and responds that this attribute is not available - DUT processes the error response and operates normally (does not crash, continues with next steps) Alternative allowed DUT behavior: - DUT is aware (from the global attributes it may have read in step 5) that the optional attributes are not available, and does not issue read requests for the attributes which it did read in step 2
