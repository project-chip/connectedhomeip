name: 3.12.5. [TC-CONTENTLAUNCHER-10.6] Launch URL Verification (DUT as Client)

PICS:
    - CONTENTLAUNCHER.C

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic Information"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: "Preconditions"

          Commission TH to DUT, if not done so already. In some cases, such as with a Casting Video Player, the TH commissions the DUT.
      disabled: true

          Product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command on the DUT. For comparison, the DUT behavior for this test step can be simulated using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissioner) or tv-casting-app (when DUT is a commissionee):

          ./chip-tool contentlauncher launch-url 'https://www.foo.com' 1 1 --DisplayString '{"providerName": "provider"}'
          ./chip-tv-casting-app contentlauncher launch-url 'https://www.foo.com' 1 1 --DisplayString '{"providerName": "provider"}'

          On TH (tv-app), Verify the  launch url command is received successfully.
