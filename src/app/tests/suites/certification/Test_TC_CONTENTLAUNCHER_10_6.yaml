name: 3.12.5. [TC-CONTENTLAUNCHER-10.6] Launch URL Verification (DUT as Client)

PICS:
    - CONTENTLAUNCHER.C

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: "DUT sends LaunchURL command to TH"
      PICS: CONTENTLAUNCHER.C.C01.Tx
      verification: |
          Product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command on the DUT. For comparison, the DUT behavior for this test step can be simulated using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissioner) or tv-casting-app (when DUT is a commissionee):

          ./chip-tool contentlauncher launch-url "https://www.foo.com" "{"providerName": "provider"}" 1 1
          ./chip-tv-casting-app contentlauncher launch-url "https://www.foo.com" "{"providerName": "provider"}" 1 1


          The log below shows the resulting log on the TH (tv-app or all-clusters-app):
