name: 32.1.9 [TC-LVL-8.1] Verification of commands (DUT as Client)"

PICS:
    - LVL.C

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic Information"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label:
          "Step 1: TH prompts the operator to make the DUT send one or more
          supported commands from the Level Control cluster"
      verification: |
          The product maker needs to provide instructions on how to trigger the command on the DUT. For comparison, the DUT behavior for this test step can be simulated using chip-tool (when the DUT is a commissioner/Client).

          The DUT should transmit correctly formed commands in any order, with application achievable values that are within the limits allowed by the specification and consistent with the attribute values reported by the TH. Verify this using the TH log of these messages.

          Please send the below command and validate the conditions mentioned above:

          ./chip-tool levelcontrol move-to-level 125 10 0 0 1 1
          on TH (all-clusters-app) log. Verify the move-to-level command is received successfully.
