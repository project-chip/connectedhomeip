name: 3.5.8. [TC-MEDIAINPUT-3.17] Rename Input Verification (DUT as Client)

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: "DUT sends RenameInput command to TH"
      PICS: MEDIAINPUT.C.C0003
      verification: |
          product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command:
          Refer to device or application documentation for special argument values to each command, and/or additional steps required to put device into in correct state to exhibit test behavior.

          If the DUT knows the Index value, then those can be sent as the argument.
          Else User needs to execute the following command to know the index InputList

           ./chip-tool mediainput read input-list 1 1

          ./chip-tool mediainput rename-input 1 'DVD' 1 1
          The following chip-tool command simulates the interaction of the DUT and the log below shows the resulting log on the TH.
