name: 3.5.7. [TC-MEDIAINPUT-3.16] Hide Input Status Verification (DUT as Client)

PICS:
    - MEDIAINPUT.C

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic Information"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: "Preconditions"
      verification: |
          Commission TH to DUT, if not done so already. In some cases, such as with a Casting Video Player, the TH commissions the DUT.
      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 1: DUT sends HideInputStatus command to TH"
      PICS: MEDIAINPUT.C.C02.Tx
      verification: |
          Product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command on the DUT. For comparison, the DUT behavior for this test step can be simulated using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissioner) or tv-casting-app (when DUT is a commissionee):

          ./chip-tool mediainput hide-input-status 1 1
          ./chip-tv-casting-app mediainput hide-input-status 1 1


          On TH (tv-app), Verify the hide input status command is received successfully.
