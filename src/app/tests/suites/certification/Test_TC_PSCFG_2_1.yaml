name: 65.2.1. [TC-PSCFG-2.1] Attributes with server as DUT

PICS:
    - PSCFG.S

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: "Commission DUT to TH"
      verification: |
          verification step to be updated.
      disabled: true

    - label: "TH reads the Sources attribute from the DUT"
      PICS: PSCFG.S.A0000
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool powersourceconfiguration read sources 1 0

           verify on TH(chip-tool) that source attribute provides a list, and each entry in the list has to be  number of an endpoint having a Power Source cluster.

          The response should look like this:
