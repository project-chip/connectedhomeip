name: Window Covering [TC-WNCV-3.3] StopMotion Verification with server as DUT

# TODO: WindowCovering tests TC-WNCV-3.3 finalize featuremap conditional dependencies

config:
    cluster: "Window Covering"
    endpoint: 1

tests:
    - label: "Wait for the commissioned device to be retrieved"
      cluster: "DelayCommands"
      command: "WaitForCommissionee"

    ### Step 1x -> Initialize Position
    ### MANDATORY Command
    - label: "1a: TH adjusts the the DUT to a non-open position"
      command: "UpOrOpen"

    ### Depends on a sleep/wait command how to do this with a real device
    - label: "1b: Wait for the movement to start and go on for a few seconds"
      disabled: true

    ### Step 2x -> Check Command instant effects + longer effects
    ### MANDATORY Command
    - label: "2a: TH sends StopMotion command to DUT"
      command: "StopMotion"

    ### MANDATORY reads
    - label: "2b: TH reads OperationalStatus attribute from DUT"
      command: "readAttribute"
      attribute: "OperationalStatus"
      response:
          value: 0

    ### 2c Check equality with a tolerance between Target & Current for Lift
    ### Depends on the FeatureMap
    - label:
          "2c-1: If (PA & LF) TH reads TargetPositionLiftPercent100ths attribute
          from DUT"
      disabled: true # Step applied conditionnally with an !expected response value

    ### Depends on the FeatureMap
