          The TH commands for this test step can be invoked using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissionee) or tv-casting-app (when DUT is a commissioner):
          ./chip-tool lowpower read accepted-command-list 1 1
          ./chip-tv-casting-app lowpower read accepted-command-list 1 1

          On TH Verify that the DUT is no longer in a low-power state by sending above command
