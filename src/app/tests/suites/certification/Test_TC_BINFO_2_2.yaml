          1. DUT and TH can interact with each other. DUT is commissioned.

          2. BINFO.S.A0009(SoftwareVersion) - TH reads SoftwareVersion attribute from DUT and saves for future use

          3. BINFO.S.A0011(Reachable) - TH reads Reachable attribute from DUT and saves for future use(should be true)

          4. BINFO.S.E00(StartUp) | BINFO.S.E01(ShutDown) && BINFO.S.E02(Leave) - TH subscribes to StartUp, ShutDown, Leave and ReachableChanged events on the Basic Information cluster of the DUT

          5. TH saves the FabricIndex during commissioning
      disabled: true

          To verify StartUp event follow the below commands , Pls use equivalent command on the respective DUT


          ./chip-tool  basicinformation read-event start-up 1 0

          verify that StartUp event as priority set has CRITICAL and software verision on TH(chip-tool)
