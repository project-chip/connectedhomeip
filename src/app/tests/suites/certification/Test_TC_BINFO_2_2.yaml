          To verify ShutDown event follow the below commands , Pls use equivalent command on the respective DUT


          1. Launch chip-tool into interactive mode with the command

          ./chip-tool interactive start

          2.  run below command in interactive mode shell and  Turn down the DUT
          basicinformation subscribe-event shut-down 20 100 1 0

          verify that ShutDown event as priority set has CRITICAL on TH(Chip-tool)
