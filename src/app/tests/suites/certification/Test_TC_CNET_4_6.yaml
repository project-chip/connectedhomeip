          1. DUT supports CNET.S.F01(TH)
          2. DUT has a Network Commissioning cluster on endpoint PIXIT.CNET.ENDPOINT_THREAD with FeatureMap attribute of 2
          3. DUT is commissioned on PIXIT.CNET.THREAD_1ST_OPERATIONALDATASET
          4. TH can communicate with the DUT on PIXIT.CNET.THREAD_1ST_OPERATIONALDATASET
