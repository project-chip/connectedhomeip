          "reachable-changed" Event is an Optional event

          As its an optional event we cannot generate the event as of now , hence no example logs provided.

          ./chip-tool basic read-event  reachable-changed 1 0

          Product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command on the DUT. For comparison, the DUT behavior for this test step can be simulated using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissioner) and TH as all-clusters-app.


          To verify shutdown event follow the below commands,

          1. Launch chip-tool into interactive mode with using the below command
          ./chip-tool interactive start


          2.  run below subscribe-event  command in interactive mode shell and then Turn down the TH (all-clusters-app)
          basic subscribe-event shut-down 20 100 1 0

          On DUT as a client side, ,verify that Shutdown event has priority set as CRITICAL
