          Build openthread POSIX cli app with RCP and have it join the thread network that the BR is part of.

          If you don"t have the app, follow the below "Instructions to build the POSIX app"

          if you have the RCP connected to the raspi, launch the ot-cli app with RCP
          $ sudo ./build/posix/src/posix/ot-cli "spinel+hdlc+uart:///dev/ttyACM0?uart-baudrate=115200" -v

          With the above set of commands, the RCP should join the thread network hosted by the BR.

          Instructions to build the posix app.
          1. Get Nordic nRF52840 dongle.
          2. Attach it to the raspi/Ubuntu machine
          Follow the instructions at https://github.com/openthread/openthread/blob/main/src/posix/README.md
          3. git clone --recursive git@github.com:openthread/openthread.git
          4. cd openthread/
          5. ./script/bootstrap
          6. ./bootstrap
          7. ./script/cmake-build posix
          8. follow the instructions to build the RCP dongle (or get the RCP image from README file in the test harness and flash it on the RCP)
          8. ./build/posix/src/posix/ot-cli "spinel+hdlc+uart:///dev/ttyACM0?uart-baudrate=115200" -v
