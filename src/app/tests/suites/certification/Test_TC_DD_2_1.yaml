          1 - The DUT is switched on and the DUT is transport-connected (BLE, Wi-Fi or Ethernet)

          To put the DUT into commissionable state and verify commissionable state.
          This step is same in couple of other cases (like DD) so use the same verification method here too i.e. if your DUT is discoverable over mDNS then use 'chiptool discover commissionables'  to discover mDNS adv and provision the device using 'chip-tool pairing code node-id payload'.
          otherwise if your DUT is advertising over BLE , pls use the '/chip-tool pairing ble-wifi 1 zigbeehome matter123 20202021 3841 --trace_decode 1' command to discover and provision the device (BTW the SSID , passwd, descriminator ..etc are configurable parameters for your DUT)

          >Here you can see the  advertisement range  under the ADV. interval feild Check the advertisement range is grater than 1200ms
          if the advertising rate is not 1285ms +/- 10ms, even though this is legal, since 1285ms is a SHOULD in the core specification.
