name: 226.2.1. [TC-RVCOPSTATE-2.1] Attribute verification [DUT as Server]

PICS:
    - RVCOPSTATE.S

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic Information"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label:
          "Step 1: Commission DUT to TH (can be skipped if done in a preceding
          test)"
      verification: |

      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 2: TH reads from the DUT the PhaseList attribute"
      PICS: RVCOPSTATE.S.A0000
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool roboticvacuumoperationalstate read phaselist 1 1

           Via the TH (chip-tool), verify:
           - that PhaseList attribute value contains either null or a list of strings.
           - that the list has no more than 32 entries. on TH(chip-tool)
      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 3: TH reads from the DUT the CurrentPhase attribute"
      PICS: RVCOPSTATE.S.A0001
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool roboticvacuumoperationalstate read currentphase 1 1

           Via the TH (chip-tool), verify:
           - if the value from Step 1 was null, verify that this is also null.
           - otherwise, verify that the CurrentPhase attribute value contains contains an integer between 0 and the size of the list from step 1 minus 1.
      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 4: TH reads from the DUT the CountdownTime attribute"
      PICS: RVCOPSTATE.S.A0002
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool roboticvacuumoperationalstate read countdowntime 1 1

           Via the TH (chip-tool), verify:
           - that CountdownTime attribute contains either null our a uint32 value
           - if non-null, verify that the value is in the range 0 to 259200
      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 5: TH reads from the DUT the OperationalStateList attribute"
      PICS: RVCOPSTATE.S.A0003
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool roboticvacuumoperationalstate read operationalstatelist 1 1

           Via the TH (chip-tool), verify:
           - the provided list contains the Error state (an entry with an ID of 0x03).
           - all entries include an ID (enum8) and a label (string)
           - all provided IDs are in the allowed range
      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 6: TH reads from the DUT the OperationalState attribute"
      PICS: RVCOPSTATE.S.A0004
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool roboticvacuumoperationalstate read operationalstate 1 1

           Via the TH (chip-tool), verify:
           - the response includes an ID (enum8) amd a label (string)
           - the provided ID is found in the set provided in step 4
           - the provided ID is in the allowed range
      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 7: TH reads from the DUT the OperationalError attribute"
      PICS: RVCOPSTATE.S.A0005
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool roboticvacuumoperationalstate read operationalerror 1 1

           Via the TH (chip-tool), verify:
           - the response includes an ID (enum8), a label (string), and additional details (string)
           - if the label is null, verify the additional details is also null
           - the provided ID is in the allowed range
      disabled: true
