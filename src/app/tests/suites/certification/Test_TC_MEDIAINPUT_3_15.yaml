name: 3.5.6. [TC-MEDIAINPUT-3.15] Show Input Status Verification (DUT as Client)

PICS:
    - MEDIAINPUT.C

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic Information"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: "Preconditions"
      verification: |
          Commission TH to DUT, if not done so already. In some cases, such as with a Casting Video Player, the TH commissions the DUT.
      disabled: true

    - label: "DUT sends ShowInputStatus command to TH"
      PICS: MEDIAINPUT.C.C01.Tx
      verification: |
          Product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command on the DUT. For comparison, the DUT behavior for this test step can be simulated using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissioner) or tv-casting-app (when DUT is a commissionee):

          ./chip-tool mediainput show-input-status 1 1
          ./chip-tv-casting-app mediainput show-input-status 1 1


          The log below shows the resulting log on the TH (tv-app or all-clusters-app):
