          product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command:
          Refer to device or application documentation for special argument values to each command, and/or additional steps required to put device into in correct state to exhibit test behavior.


          ./chip-tool contentlauncher launch-content '{"parameterList": []}' 1 1 1
          The following chip-tool command simulates the interaction of the DUT and the log below shows the resulting log on the TH.
