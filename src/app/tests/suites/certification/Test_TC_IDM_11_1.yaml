      verification: |

          "Step 2: For every returned attribute, if the attribute type is string
          and the returned value is not Null or empty, ensure the returned value
          is a valid UTF-8-encoded string. It is not permitted to have partially
          encoded codepoints between the last legally-encoded codepoint and the
          end of the string."
      verification: |
          From the privious step log,  Verify UTF-8 Encoding for Each Returned String Attribute.
          For each returned attribute with the attribute type "string," follow the verification process:
          1. Check if the returned value is not Null or empty.
          2. If the returned value is not Null or empty, validate that it is a valid UTF-8-encoded string.
          3. Ensure that there are no partially encoded codepoints between the last legally-encoded codepoint and the end of the string.

          The following log is an example of the output obtained for Basic Inforamtion Cluster. Pls repeat this for every cluster on every endpoint. The log represents the attributes of clusters found on different endpoints.

          Verification Instructions:
          Please use the provided example log as a guide to verify the attributes for other clusters and endpoints in a similar manner.
