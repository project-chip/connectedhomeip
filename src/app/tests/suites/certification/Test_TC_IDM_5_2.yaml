name: 3.7.2. [TC-IDM-5.2] Timed Request Action TH to DUT

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label:
          "TH sends a Timed Request Message with the timeout value set. (Example
          - 200 milliseconds)."
      verification: |
          for below example command is verified by using write interaction
          ./chip-tool onoff on 1 1 --timedInteractionTimeoutMs 200
      disabled: true

    - label:
          "TH sends a Timed Request Message with the timeout value set. (Example
          - 200 milliseconds). Wait for the status response message to be
          received. Wait for 5 seconds(Timer has expired) and then send a Write
          Request Message to the DUT."
      verification: |
          here is the example command you can use

          '' ./chip-tool onoff on 1 1 --repeat-delay-ms 5000  --timedInteractionTimeoutMs 200

          Verify we are getting status response and UNSUPPORTED_ACCESS from TH to DUT for above command
