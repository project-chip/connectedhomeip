name: 202.2.4. [TC-OPSTATE-2.4] Mandatory Events with DUT as Server

PICS:
    - OPSTATE.S

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic Information"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: "Step 1: Commission DUT to TH"
      verification: |

      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 2: Set up a subscription to the OperationalError event"
      PICS: OPSTATE.S.E00
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool operationalstate subscribe operational-error 5 15 1 1
      disabled: true

    - label:
          "Step 3: At the DUT take the vendor defined action to generate an
          OperationalError event"
      PICS: OPSTATE.S.E00
      verification: |
          After the subscription interval via the TH (chip-tool) verify:
          - reception of an OperationalError Event
          - ErrorStateID is a defined error
          - If the ErrorStateID is manufacturer specific, inclusion of an ErrorStateLabel, not present otherwise
          - Optionally an ErrorStateDetails
      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 4: TH reads from the DUT the OperationalState attribute"
      PICS: OPSTATE.S.A0004
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool operationalstate read operational-state 1 1

          Via the TH (chip-tool), verify:
          - the response has an OperationalStateID field that is set to 0x03 (Error)
      disabled: true
