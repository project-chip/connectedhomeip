name: 260.2.1. [TC-OTCCM-1.2] Cluster attributes with DUT as Server

PICS:
    - OTCCM.S

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Oven Mode"
    endpoint: 1

tests:
    - label:
          "Step 1: Commission DUT to TH (can be skipped if done in a preceding
          test)."
      verification: |

      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 2: TH reads from the DUT the SupportedModes attribute."
      PICS: OTCCM.S.A0000
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool Ovenmode read supported-modes 1 1

          Verify that the DUT response contains list of ModeOptionsStruct entries.
          - Verify that the list has at least 2 and at most 255 entries
          - Verify that each ModeOptionsStruct entry has a unique Mode field value and Label field value
          - If ModeOptionsStruct entryâ€™s ModeTags field is not empty,  then Verify the values of the Value fields that are not larger than 16 bits, for each Value field: Is the mode tag value a defined common tag value ( Auto(0x0000), Quick(0x0001), Quiet(0x0002), LowNoise(0x0003), LowEnergy(0x0004), Vacation(0x0005), Min(0x0006), Max(0x0007), Night(0x0008), Day(0x0009)) or a defined cluster derived tag value ( Normal, Delicate, Heavy, Whites) or in the MfgTags (0x8000 to 0xBFFF) range
          - If the Value field is in the MfgTags (0x8000 to 0xBFFF) range, the TagName field is a string with a length between 1 and 64
          - Verify that at least one ModeOptionsStruct entry includes the Normal mode tag
          - Save the Mode field values as supported_modes_dut on the TH (Chip-tool)
      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 3: TH reads from the DUT the CurrentMode attribute."
      PICS: OTCCM.S.A0001
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool Ovenmode read current-mode 1 1

          Verify on TH(chip-tool) logs, CurrentMode attribute value is an integer value from supported_modes_dut

      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 4: TH reads from the DUT the OnMode attribute."
      PICS: OTCCM.S.A0003
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool Ovenmode read on-mode 1 1

          Verify on TH(chip-tool) logs, OnMode attribute value is an integer value from supported_modes_dut or null
      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 5: TH reads from the DUT the StartUpMode attribute."
      PICS: OTCCM.S.A0002
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool Ovenmode read start-up-mode 1 1

          Verify on TH(chip-tool) logs, StartUpMode attribute value is an integer value from supported_modes_dut or null
      disabled: true
