name: 219.1.2. [TC-TCCM-1.2] Cluster attributes with DUT as Server

PICS:
    - TCCM.S

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic Information"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label:
          "Step 1: Commission DUT to TH (can be skipped if done in a preceding
          test)."

      verification: |
          Verify that the DUT response contains a list of ModeOptionsStruct entries

          Verify that the list has at least one entry

          Verify that each ModeOptionsStruct entry has a unique Mode field value

          Verify that each ModeOptionsStruct entry has a unique Label field value

          Verify that each ModeOptionsStruct entryâ€™s ModeTags field, if not empty, has:
          the values of the Value fields that are not larger than 16 bits

          for each Value field: Is the semantic tag value a defined common tag value (Auto(0x0000), Quick(0x0001), Quiet(0x0002), LowNoise(0x0003), LowEnergy(0x0004), Vacation(0x0005), Min(0x0006), Max(0x0007), Night(0x0008), Day(0x0009)) or a defined cluster alias tag value (RapidCool, RapidFreeze) or in the MfgTags (0x8000 to 0xBFFF) range

          if the Value field is in the MfgTags (0x8000 to 0xBFFF) range, the TagName field is a string with a length between 1 and 64



          Verify that at least one ModeOptionsStruct entry includes either the RapidCool semantic tag or the RapidFreeze semantic tag in the SemanticTags field

          Save the Mode field values as supported_modes_dut
      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 3: TH reads from the DUT the CurrentMode attribute."
