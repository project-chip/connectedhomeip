name: 219.3.2. [TC-TCCM-3.2] Startup Mode functionality with DUT as Server

PICS:
    - TCCM.S

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic Information"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label:
          "Step 1: Commission DUT to TH (can be skipped if done in a preceding
          test)."
      verification: |

      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 2: TH reads from the DUT the StartUpMode attribute."
      PICS: TCCM.S.A0002
      verification: |
          Verify that the DUT response contains an integer value

          Save the value as startup_mode_dut
      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 3: TH reads from the DUT the CurrentMode attribute."
      PICS: TCCM.S.A0001
      verification: |
          Verify that the DUT response contains an integer value

          Save the value as old_current_mode_dut

          If startup_mode_dut is equal to old_current_mode_dut proceed to step 4. Else proceed to step 6.
      disabled: true

    - label: "Step 4: TH reads from the DUT the SupportedModes attribute."
      PICS: TCCM.S.A0000
      verification: |
          Verify that the DUT response contains a list of ModeOptionsStruct entries

          Verify that the list has two or more entries

          Save the Mode field values as supported_modes_dut

          Select a value from supported_modes_dut different from startup_mode_dut. Save the value as new_mode_th.
      disabled: true

          to new_mode_th"
      PICS: TCCM.S.C00.Rsp
      verification: |
          Verify that the DUT response contains a ChangeToModeResponse command w/ data fields: * Status, set to Success(0x00).

      PICS: TCCM.S.A0001
      verification: |
          Verify that the DUT response contains an integer value

          The value is equal to startup_mode_dut
