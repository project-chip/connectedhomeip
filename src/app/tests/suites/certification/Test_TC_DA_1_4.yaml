          3. Similary for 3rd error condition follow the below steps
          All  sample error scenario certificate has generated and present in ~/connectedhomeip/credentials/development/commissioner_dut/
          Use the appropriate folder to test different scenario.

          vendor_id field in the Certification Declaration does not match with the VendorID attribute found in the Basic Information cluster
          connectedhomeip/credentials/development/commissioner_dut/struct_cd_vid_mismatch
          & use the sample json test_case_vector.json

          execute the below mentioned command to put TH(all-cluster-app) into a commissionable state, Pls use equivalent command on the respective Platform
           ./chip-all-clusters-app  --trace_decode 1 --dac_provider ~/Aug30_cntr/connectedhomeip/credentials/development/commissioner_dut/struct_cd_vid_mismatch/test_case_vector.json

          Once TH(all-clusters-app) reach the  commissionable state pls send below mentioned command on DUT(chip-tool). Pls use equivalent command on the respective platform
           ./chip-tool pairing onnetwork 1 20202021 --trace_decode 1
          If the DUT(chip-tool) has to provision to verify the logs:- verify the below mentioned same behaviour log on the DUT (chip-tool):

          4. Similary for 4th error condition follow the below steps

          All  sample error scenario certificate has generated and present in ~/connectedhomeip/credentials/development/commissioner_dut/
          Use the appropriate folder to test different scenario.

          The Vendor ID in the DAC does not match the vendor_id field in the Certification Declaration.
          connectedhomeip/credentials/development/commissioner_dut/struct_cd_pid_array_count01_mismatch
          & use the sample json test_case_vector.json

          Commission TH to DUT by using --dac_provider parameter

          execute the below mentioned command to put TH(all-cluster-app) into a commissionable state, Pls use equivalent command on the respective Platform
          ./chip-all-clusters-app  --trace_decode 1 --dac_provider ~/Aug30_cntr/connectedhomeip/credentials/development/commissioner_dut/struct_cd_pid_array_count10_mismatch/test_case_vector.json
