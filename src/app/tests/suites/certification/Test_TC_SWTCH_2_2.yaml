          In Raspi platform to change the switch to second position use the below command, Pls use equivalent command on the respective DUT.open one more terminal on DUT side execute the echo command on that terminal.

          echo "{"Name":"MultiPressOngoing","NewPosition":1,"CurrentNumberOfPressesCounted":3}" > /tmp/chip_all_clusters_fifo_<PID>  (PID of DUT)
