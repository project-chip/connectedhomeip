          For devices not on the network (i.e. BLE discovery):
          1. Discover commissionables over BLE using a BLE discovery tool of choice.
          Try NRF Connect app (https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-connect-for-desktop)
          OR
          HCIDump (https://ubuntu.com/core/docs/bluez/reference/commands)

          1. Pair the DUT commissionee using the TH=chip-tool commissioner on the applicable Discovery technology (IP, BLE, etc.)
          2. Verify that the DUT is commissioned to the TH commissioner successfully

           ./chip-tool pairing code 1 MT:-24J029Q00KA0648G00

          Verify on the TH (CHIP-TOOL):
