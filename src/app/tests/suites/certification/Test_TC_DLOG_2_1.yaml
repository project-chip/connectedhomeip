          1. Execute the below commands in the interactive mode:
          ./chip-tool interactive start
          2. Before running the below steps ensure that  \tmp folder on the system does not contain the below files. If they are present please delete these files
          TH_LOG_OK_NORMAL : "Length_1234567.txt"
          TH_LOG_OK_FULL_LENGTH : "Length_123456789123456789123.txt"
          3.
          NOTE : The below setting is shown for sample, DUT can be setting logs of any size.

          Use the below command in the all-cluster-app for setting up the diagonistics logs.
          ./chip-all-clusters-app --trace_decode 1 --end_user_support_log ~/tmp/end_user_support_log.txt --network_diagnostics_log ~/tmp/nw_log.txt --crash_log ~/tmp/crash_log.txt
          The log file content can be set such that the file size can be as follows to obtain different status code from DUT:
          1. end_user_support_log  > 1024 bytes
          2. Make sure that nw_log.txt does not exist
          3. crash_log <= 1024 bytes

          2. File Transfer Verification:
          - Check the size of the file specified in the File Designator field of the RetrieveLogsRequest command.
          - Confirm that the size is greater than 1024 bytes.
          - Example file: Length_123456789123456789123.txt
          - Verify that the file is transferred to the /tmp folder on the build system and its size is greater than 1024 bytes.

          Notes:
          The file can be stored in any location on the build system.
          The current SDK implementation stores log files transferred via the BDX protocol in the /tmp folder.
          if {PICS_MCORE_DLOG_S_UTCTIMESTAMP} then verify that UTCTimeStamp is included in the RetrieveLogsResponse command
