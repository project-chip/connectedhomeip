name: 18.5.5. [TC-MC-3.14] Select Input Verification (DUT as Client)

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: "DUT sends SelectInput command to TH"
      PICS: MC_MEDIAINPUT.C.C0000
      verification: |
          The following chip-tool command simulates the interaction of the DUT and the log below shows the resulting log on the TH.
          If the DUT knows the Index value, then those can be sent as the argument.
          Else User needs to execute the following command to know the index InputList
              ./chip-tool mediainput read  input-list 1 1


          ./chip-tool mediainput select-input 0 1 1
