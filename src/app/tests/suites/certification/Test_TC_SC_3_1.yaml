    - label:
          "Initiator constructs and sends a TLV-encoded Sigma1 message
          containing a random initiation value, destination identifier, session
          identifier, the public key for its ephemeral key pair, and optional
          MRP parameters."
      verification: |
          Verify that the message is properly formatted: 1. I Flag is set to 1 2. S flag and DIZ fields of message flags are set to 0 3. Encryption Type of security flags is set to 0 4. The message payload follows the sigma-1-struct TLV encoding format 5. The Session Key Type field is set to 0 6. The Protocol ID field is set to 0 and Protocol Opcode field is set to 48 (0x30) Verify that the responder receives the message.
      disabled: true

    - label:
          "Responder validates the destination identifier contained in the
          message."
      verification: |
          If the destination identifier matches a candidate destination id (as generated by the process in spec section 4.13.2.4), the responder proceeds to generate a Sigma 2 message.
      disabled: true

    - label:
          "Responder constructs and sends a TLV-encoded Sigma2 message
          containing a random responder value, responder session id, trusted
          root id, public key for its responder ephemeral key pair, and
          encrypted integrity data."

          Verify that the message is properly formatted: 1. I flag is set to 0 2. S flag and DIZ fields of message flags are set to 0 3. Encryption Type of security flags is set to 0 4. The message payload follows the sigma-2-struct TLV encoding format 5. The Session Key Type field is set to 0 6. The Protocol ID field is set to 0 and Protocol Opcode field is set to 49 (0x31) Verify that the initiator receives the message.

    - label:
          "Initiator generates a shared secret, generates a S2K key, and
          decrypts and verifies the message data, node operational certificate
          (NOC), and signature data."
      verification: |
          If the verification succeeds, the initiator moves to the next step to send a Sigma3 message.

      verification: |
          If the verification succeed, the session is established and the responder sends a SigmaFinished StatusReport message with GeneralCode SUCCESS, ProtocolId PROTOCOL_ID_SECURE_CHANNEL, and ProtocolCode SessionEstablishmentSuccess.
