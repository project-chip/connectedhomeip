          1. On your DUT controller connect using wrong passcode. Repeat the step for 20 times.

          Below the example when using chip tool as controller

    - label: "DUT_CR1 starts a 21st commissioning process with a valid passcode"
      verification: |
          1. On your DUT controller  connect using IP address and correct passcode.
