name: 3.1.1. [TC-IDM-1.1] Invoke Request Action from DUT to TH - [{DUT_Client}]

PICS:

          Chip-tool command used below are an example to verify the  DUT as client test cases. For certification test, we expect DUT should have a capability or way to run the equivalent command.

          Product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command on the DUT. For comparison, the DUT behavior for this test step can be simulated using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissioner/Client)

          ./chip-tool onoff on 1 1

          On TH all-clusters-app,  Verify we are getting EndpointID, CommandID, ClusterID in the response data (as below) matching with the data sent in the above command
