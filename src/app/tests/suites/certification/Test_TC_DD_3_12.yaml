          1 - DUT is on an operational network and has accurate date, time, timezone, regulatory, and fabric information available.

          2 - 5.1.3 - QR Code is printed on the Commissionee device or in additional provided materials (ex: manual, companion app, web service).

          An example onboarding QR code could be "MT:-24J029Q00KA0648G00" (following 5.1.3 "QR Code", Table 34 "Packed Binary Data Structure for Onboarding Payload") which includes:

          - 3-bit Version String=000

          - 16-bit Vendor ID=0xFFF1 (as defined in section 2.5.2. "Vendor Identifier")

          - 16-bit Product ID=0x8001 (as defined in section 2.5.3. "Product Identifier")

          - 2-bit Custom Flow=10 (Custom Commissioning Flow = 2)

          - 8-bit Discovery Capabilities Bitmask=00000100 (OnNetwork)

          - 12-bit Discriminator=0xF00

          - 27-bit Passcode=20202021

          - 4-bit Padding=0000

          - no variable-length TLV Data included (as defined in section 5.1.3.1. "Payload", subsection "TLV Data")
