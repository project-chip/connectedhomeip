          1 - DUT is on an operational network and has accurate date, time, timezone, regulatory, and fabric information available.

          2 - 5.1.3 - QR Code is printed on the Commissionee device or in additional provided materials (ex: manual, companion app, web service).

          An example onboarding QR code could be "MT:-24J029Q00KA0648G00" (following 5.1.3 "QR Code", Table 34 "Packed Binary Data Structure for Onboarding Payload") which includes:

          - 3-bit Version String=000
