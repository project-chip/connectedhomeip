          To Execute the TC-MOD-3.4 test case using reboot in raspi device we followed the below suggested way:

          To run a reboot test case on raspi, run the app with --KVS flag with a file in local directory and pass that file to the command to launch the app. Steps


            step-1:  create a file using touch command , something like touch mytest.txt
            step-2:  chmod 777 mytest.txt
            step-3:  launch the app ./chip-all-clusters-app --KVS ./mytest.txt

          if you launch the app with the above commands and provision the app, even when you reboot the app with 'sudo reboot' , next time you launch the app with 'sudo ./out/all-clusters-app/chip-all-clusters-app --KVS ./mytest.txt' , you can run read/write attribs and commands without reprovisioning the device.

          To execute this test case set onmode to any integer value because as default it value has null.

          ./chip-tool modeselect write on-mode 4 1 1

          This test case is verified after the device is provisioned. Pls provision device first, Pass appropriate nodeID in the below command

          ./chip-tool modeselect read start-up-mode 1 1

          On TH(chip-tool) log, Verify DUT response is an integer.
          - Record this value for usage in step 2,  below is the sample log provided for the raspi platform:
