          Chip-tool command used below are an example to verify the DUT as commissioner test cases. For certification test, we expect DUT should have a capability or way to run the equivalent command.

          1 - 5.4.3. Discovery by Commissioner - DUT supports BLE (central role), Wi-Fi and IP connectivity - Wi-Fi certified n client

          2 - Test Harness must support all discovery transport technologies as the DUT (i.e. BLE, Wi-Fi and IP connectivity)

          To put the DUT into commissionable state and verify commissionable state.
          This step is same in couple of other cases (like DD) so use the same verification method here too i.e. if your DUT is discoverable over mDNS then use "chiptool discover commissionables"  to discover mDNS adv and provision the device using "chip-tool pairing code node-id payload".
          otherwise if your DUT is advertising over BLE , pls use the "/chip-tool pairing ble-wifi 1 zigbeehome matter123 20202021 3841 --trace_decode 1" command to discover and provision the device (BTW the SSID , passwd, descriminator ..etc are configurable parameters for your DUT)
