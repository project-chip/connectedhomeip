          1.Commission TH and DUT over BLE to setup the Wi-Fi

          2.The cluster Identifier 49 (0x0031) is present in the ServerList
          attribute

          3.The FeatureMap attribute value is 1

          ./chip-tool networkcommissioning read feature-map 1 0

          Via the TH (chip-tool), verify that FeatureMap attribute value as 1 for WiFiNetworkInterface.
