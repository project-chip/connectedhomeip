          For each scenario outlined in the sheet TC-DA-1.8 test cases, perform the following actions
          - Start the TH using the required certificate set and PID. For chip-all-clusters-app, use the command given in the chip-all-clusters app command column
          - Have the DUT commission the TH. Verify that the DUT indicates that the device is not genuine, or otherwise indicates a failure of device attestation, within its error handling APIs or user interface.
