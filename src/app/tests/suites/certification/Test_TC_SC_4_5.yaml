          DNS-SD"
      verification: |
          1. On the raspi controller, publish matter service, using below command

          $avahi-publish-service 87E1B004E235A130-8FC7772401CD0696 _matter._tcp 22222 CRI=3000 CRA=4000 T=0

          "By any means, DUT is instructed to perform an unicast UDP query to
          the DNS-SD Discovery Proxy on TH for services"
      verification: |
          1. Proviosion the node(accessory/device) to thread network

          2. Open the matter shell in the SDK and run resolve command, Verify if the device detects the published IP address and the Common Txt Key/Value Pairs , as advertised in the service. Ref below example.
