          1. Take two routers connected to the same ISP as input.
          2. Execute step 1 to step 5 using Router1 Configuration.
          3. Once step 1 to step 5 are executed in Router1 switch TH and DUT to Router2.
          4. Execute step 1 to step 5 using Router2 Configuration.
          5. Check the IP so that the Routers(Router1 and Router2) will have different IPs to Raspi.
