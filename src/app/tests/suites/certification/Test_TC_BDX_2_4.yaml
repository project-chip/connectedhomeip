          back to DUT + DUT sends a Block message to TH"
      verification: |
          Verify that the Block message has the following mandatory fields Block Counter - Must start at 0 at the start of the transfer. Data - The length must be in the range [0 < Length ⇐ Max Block Size], where Max Block Size is the negotiated Max Block Size matching the SendAccept message that initiated the transfer.

      verification: |
          Verify that the Blocks are sent in ascending and sequential block counter order.

          Verify that the BlockEOF message has the following mandatory fields Block Counter Data - The length must be in the range [0 ⇐ Length ⇐ Max Block Size], where Max Block Size is the negotiated Max Block Size matching the SendAccept message that initiated the transfer. Verify that the pre-negotiated file size was transferred, if a definite size had been given.
