name: 3.2.2. [TC-DGSW-2.2] Event Functionality [{DUT_Sever}]

PICS:
    - DGSW.S.E
    - DGSW.S

config:
    nodeId: 0x12344321
    cluster: "Basic"
    endpoint: 0

tests:
    - label: "Commission DUT to TH"
      verification: |

      disabled: true

    - label:
          "DUT sends an event report to TH. TH reads a list of SoftwareFault
          struct from DUT."
      PICS: DGSW.S.E00
      verification: |
          Provision DUT and TH.

          On Raspi platform To trigger the event give the below command by opening an another terminal in DUT (Below is the example command developed in all-clusters-app to generate the event, Vendor Dut should have capability to generate this event)

          echo '{"Name":"SoftwareFault"}' > /tmp/chip_all_clusters_fifo-<PID>   (PID of all-clusters-app by using command provided in note above)


          On  TH Send the below command

          2. ./chip-tool softwarediagnostics read-event software-fault 1 0

          Verify SoftwareFault Struct is listed that is Softwarefault, ID, Name, Fault recording should be present in struct and Priority should be Info in TH(chip-tool) Log
