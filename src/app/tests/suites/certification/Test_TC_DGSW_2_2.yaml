          Events to be executed as following
          1. Compile app using below command in connectedhomeip folder
          a. ./scripts/run_in_build_env.sh "./scripts/build/build_examples.py --target linux-arm64-all-clusters-no-ble-asan-clang build"
          2. Build respective app (all-clusters-app)
          3. Commission DUT to TH
          4. Open 2nd terminal of DUT and provide the below command to obtain PID of DUT ps  -aef|grep all-clusters-app
          5. Follow the Verification step below to generate the event in 2nd terminal of DUT

          "DUT sends an event report to TH. TH reads a list of SoftwareFault
          struct from DUT."
      PICS: DGSW.S.E00
      verification: |
          Provision DUT and TH.

          On Raspi platform To trigger the event give the below command by opening an another terminal in DUT (Below is the example command developed in all-clusters-app to generate the event, Vendor Dut should have capability to generate this event)

          echo '{"Name":"SoftwareFault"}' > /tmp/chip_all_clusters_fifo_<PID>   (PID of all-clusters-app by using command provided in note above)


          On  TH Send the below command

          2. ./chip-tool softwarediagnostics read-event software-fault 1 0

          Verify SoftwareFault Struct is listed that is Softwarefault, ID, Name, Fault recording should be present in struct and Priority should be Info in TH(chip-tool) Log
