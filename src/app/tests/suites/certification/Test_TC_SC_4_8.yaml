          Chip-tool command used below are an example to verify the  DUT as commissioner test cases. For certification test, we expect DUT should have a capability or way to run the equivalent command.

          1. Provision the device using 1st controller chip-tool (as example commissioner) on the raspi (use the instructions)

          ./chip-tool pairing onnetwork 2 20202021


          avahi-browse _matter._tcp -rt

          Verify Compressed Fabric ID on the TH Log:

          Using your DUT Controller connect to the accessory.

          Below is the example when using chip tool as controller

          ./chip-tool pairing ble-wifi 1 chipsetup4 matter123 20202021 3841
