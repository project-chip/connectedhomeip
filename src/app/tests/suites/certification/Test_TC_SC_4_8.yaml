          1. Provision the device using 1st controller chip-tool (as example commissioner) on the raspi (use above instructions)


          ./chip-tool pairing onnetwork 2 20202021

          Assigned compressed fabric ID: 0xF3C001637A30CEEC
          Assigned compressed fabric ID: 0xBE320A8460153487
          Assigned compressed fabric ID: 0x8A124463B858624F

          Using your DUT Controller connect to the accessory.

          Below is the example when using chip tool as controller

          ./chip-tool pairing ble-wifi 1 chipsetup4 matter123 20202021 3841

          Assigned compressed fabric ID: 0xF3C001637A30CEEC

          Assigned compressed fabric ID: 0x8A124463B858624F

          Verify you got below message
          Device commissioning completed with success
      disabled: true

    - label: "Send RemoveFabric from DUT to TH1 and comission DUT to TH1 again"
      verification: |
          ./chip-tool operationalcredentials remove-fabric 1 1 0

          Verify the below log on the DUT as client device
