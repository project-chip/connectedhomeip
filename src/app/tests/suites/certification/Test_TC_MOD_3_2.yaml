          To Execute the TC-MOD-3.2 test case using reboot in raspi device we followed the below suggested way:

          To run a reboot test case on raspi, run the app with --KVS flag with a file in local directory and pass that file to the command to launch the app. Steps


            step-1:  create a file using touch command , something like touch mytest.txt
            step-2:  chmod 777 mytest.txt
            step-3:  launch the app ./chip-all-clusters-app --KVS ./mytest.txt

          if you launch the app with the above commands and provision the app, even when you reboot the app with 'sudo reboot' , next time you launch the app with 'sudo ./out/all-clusters-app/chip-all-clusters-app --KVS ./mytest.txt' , you can run read/write attribs and commands without reprovisioning the device.

          On TH(chip-tool), Verify  DUT response is an integer and Record this value for usage in step 2, below is the sample log provided for the raspi platform:
