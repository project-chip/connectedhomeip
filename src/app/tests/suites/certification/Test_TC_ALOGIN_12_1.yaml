          The TH commands for this test step can be invoked using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissionee) or tv-casting-app (when DUT is a commissioner).

          The following command on the example tv-app will launch a content app on endpoint 4:
          ./chip-tool applicationlauncher launch-app "{"catalogVendorId": 123, "applicationId": "exampleid"}" 1 1
          ./chip-tv-casting-app applicationlauncher launch-app "{"catalogVendorId": 123, "applicationId": "exampleid"}" 1 1

          Verify in TH Log:
