    Window Covering [TC-WNCV-4.2] GoToTiltPercentage Long-Run Verification with

    endpoint: 1

tests:
    ### Step 1x -> Initialize the Covering position before any testing
    ### MANDATORY Init Commands
    - label:
          "1a: TH sends DownOrClose command to preposition the DUT in the
          opposite direction"
      command: "DownOrClose"

    ### Depends on the FeatureMap -> Check CurrentPosition attributes
