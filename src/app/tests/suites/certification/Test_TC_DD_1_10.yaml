          1 - 5.1.8 - NFC tag follows guidelines set in section 5.1.8 of spec.

          An example onboarding payload could be "MT:-24J029Q00KA0648G00" (following Table 34 "Packed Binary Data Structure for Onboarding Payload") which includes:

          - 3-bit Version String=000

          - 16-bit Vendor ID=0xFFF1 (as defined in section 2.5.2. "Vendor Identifier")

          - 16-bit Product ID=0x8001 (as defined in section 2.5.3. "Product Identifier")

          - 2-bit Custom Flow=10 (Custom Commissioning Flow = 2)

          - 8-bit Discovery Capabilities Bitmask=00000100 (OnNetwork)

          - 12-bit Discriminator=0xF00

          - 27-bit Passcode=20202021

          - 4-bit Padding=0000

          - no variable-length TLV Data included (as defined in section 5.1.3.1. "Payload", subsection "TLV Data")

      verification: |
          1. Bring and hold the DUT close to the NFC tag on the TH Device.
          2. Check whether the DUT can read the NFC tag.
          3. If the DUT can read the NFC tag, it should retrieve the information needed for onboarding.
          4. Verify that the DUT can successfully read and decode the NFC tagâ€™s onboarding payload such as the setup code, device details and use the retrieved information to onboard the TH device onto the Matter network.
