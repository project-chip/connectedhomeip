          Send a read request to the DUT using chip-tool to read the partsList attribute in the descriptor cluster on Endpoint 0.
          Make a note of all the items(Endpoint id’s) in the list. In the below example there are 2 endpoint id's listed [1,2]

          ./chip-tool descriptor read  parts-list 1 0

          Verify "PartsList" attribute is not empty (use this list of endpoints in step 1b) on the TH (Chip-tool) and below is the sample log provided for the raspi platform:
