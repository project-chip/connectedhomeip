          Send a read request to the DUT using chip-tool to read the partsList attribute in the descriptor cluster on Endpoint 0.
          Make a note of all the items(Endpoint id’s) in the list. In the below example there are 2 endpoint id's listed [1,2]

          ./chip-tool descriptor read  parts-list 1 0

          Verify "PartsList" attribute is not empty (use this list of endpoints in step 1b) on the TH (Chip-tool) and below is the sample log provided for the raspi platform:

          - Read each TagStruct from the list and check for the following:
            - Number of entries in TagList is in the range of 1 to 6 and each entry contains at least a NamespaceID and a Tag property. Confirm that each entry is unique (i.e. no duplicate tags).
            - If the MfgCode field is not null, confirm that it is the Vendor ID of the manufacturer who has defined a certain namespace and that the NamespaceID field indicates which namespace from the manufacturer is associated with the Tag field.
            - Confirm that each non-manufacturer specific tag is from a namespace defined in the spec (either from an common namespace or from a namespace for the particular device type).
            - If a manufacturer specific Tag field is indicated, at least one standardized tag which is not from any manufacturer’s namespace shall be included in the TagList.
            - Tag field is the ID of a semantic tag within the namespace indicated by the NamespaceID property.
