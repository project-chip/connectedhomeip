tests:
    - label:
          "TH generates and sends PBKDFParamRequest with an invalid passcodeID"
      verification: |
          Verify DUT receives the PBKDFParamRequest message.
      disabled: true

    - label: "DUT verifies the passcodeID."
      verification: |
          Verify that the DUT fails verification of the passcodeID and sends a status report to the TH with a FAILURE general code (value 1), protocol ID of SECURE_CHANNEL (0x0000), and Protocol code of INVALID_PARAMETER (0X0002). Verify that the DUT performs no further processing after sending the status report.
      disabled: true
