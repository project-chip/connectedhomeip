# !!!!!!!!!! TEST INFORMATION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# This test file tests Group Multicast Messaging.
# For this test to work, A Group Write/Command and a unicast read need to occur to be able to confirm that the group Communication works. Every test comes in a pair
# Only Works on Linux machines
# When building chip-tool, chip_enable_group_messaging_tests needs to be set to true in the build command for the test to pass
