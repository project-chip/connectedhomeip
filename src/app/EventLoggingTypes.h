 * @details
 * Priority is used as a way to filter events before they are
 * actually emitted into the log. After the event is in the log, we
 * make no further provisions to expunge it from the log.
 * The priority level serves to prioritize event storage. If an
 * event of high priority is added to a full buffer, events are
 * dropped in order of priority (and age) to accommodate it. As such,
 * priority levels only have relative value. If a system is
 * using only one priority level, events are dropped only in order
 * of age, like a ring buffer.
