    <description>The Access Control List (ACL) Cluster is the mechanism by which access privileges are maintained and enforced. Every Node has exactly one ACL Cluster instance, on endpoint 0, which contains ACL entries for the entire Node and its endpoints. Access to this ACL Cluster is itself subject to a special ACL privilege level, such that only Administrative Nodes (hereafter termed "Administrators") can edit ACL entries. The ACL Cluster SHALL be present on Endpoint 0 of each Node. The ACL Cluster SHALL NOT be present on any other Endpoint of any Node.</description>
