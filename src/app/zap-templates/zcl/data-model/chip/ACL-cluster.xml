    <description>The Access Control Cluster exposes a data model view of a Node’s Access Control List (ACL), which
codifies the rules used to manage and enforce Access Control for the Node’s endpoints and their
associated cluster instances. Access to this Access Control Cluster itself requires a special
Administer privilege level, such that only Nodes granted such privilege (hereafter termed
"Administrators") can manage the Access Control Cluster.</description>
