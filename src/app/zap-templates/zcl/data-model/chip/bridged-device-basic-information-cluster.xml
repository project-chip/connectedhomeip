    <description>This Cluster serves two purposes towards a Node communicating with a Bridge:
indicate that the functionality on the Endpoint where it is placed (and its Parts) is bridged from
a non-CHIP technology, and
provide a centralized collection of attributes that the Node MAY collect to aid in conveying
information regarding the Bridged Device to a user, such as the vendor name, the model name,
or user-assigned name.</description>
