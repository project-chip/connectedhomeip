 *  @class ReadClient
 *
 *  @brief The read client represents the initiator side of a Read Or Subscribe Interaction (depending on the APIs invoked).
 *
 *         When used to manage subscriptions, the client provides functionality to automatically re-subscribe as needed,
 *         including re-establishing CASE under certain conditions (see Callback::OnResubscriptionNeeded for more info).
 *         This is the default behavior. A consumer can completely opt-out of this behavior by over-riding
 *         Callback::OnResubscriptionNeeded and providing an alternative implementation.
