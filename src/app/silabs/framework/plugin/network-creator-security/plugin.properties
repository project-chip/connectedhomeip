name=Network Creator Security

description=This plugin will perform the necessary security initialization to form a ZigBee 3.0 compliant network. If users want to enable "Allow Trust Center rejoin with well known key", the "emberAfPluginEzspSecurityTrustCenterJoinCallback()" function (on the NCP side) may need to be implemented. For more details about this callback function, please refer to "https://www.silabs.com/community/wireless/zigbee-and-thread/knowledge-base.entry.html/2018/12/26/how_to_allow_unsecur-sa3C". If the link does not work, please go to our community website and search "How to allow unsecure rejoins on the Ember ZNet stack".
