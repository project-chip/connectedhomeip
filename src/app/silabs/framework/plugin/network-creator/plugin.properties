name=Network Creator

description=This plugin will perform the necessary steps to create a network according to the Base Device Behavior specification. The plugin will perform an active scan followed by an energy scan across a primary channel set in order to decide which channel(s) are valid candidates for network formation. If the plugin fails to form a network on any primary channels, it moves to a secondary channel mask. Before every attempt at network formation, this plugin will setup the stack to use ZigBee 3.0 security.

scanDuration.name=Scan duration exponent
scanDuration.description=The exponent of the number of scan periods, where a scan period is 960 symbols, and a symbol is 16 miscroseconds.  The scan will occur for ((2^duration) + 1) scan periods.
scanDuration.type=NUMBER:0,14
scanDuration.default=4
# For default value, see Base Device specification (13-0402) section 6.2.11.

channelMask.name=Channel mask
channelMask.description=The channels that the plugin will scan when forming and joining.
channelMask.type=CHANNELS
channelMask.default=0x02108800
# For default value, see Base Device specification (13-0402) section 6.2.10.

channelBeaconsThreshold.name=Channel beacons threshold
channelBeaconsThreshold.description=This is the highest number of beacons that the network creator will hear on a channel and still try to form a network. If the network creator hears more than this ammount of beacons on one channel, it will disregard this channel from the formation process.
channelBeaconsThreshold.type=NUMBER:0,255
channelBeaconsThreshold.default=20

radioPower.name=Radio power to use on the formed network.
radioPower.description=This is the default radio power that will be used on the network. The units are in dBm.
radioPower.type=NUMBER:-8,20
radioPower.default=3
