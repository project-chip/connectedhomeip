# Description of the plugin.
description=Silicon Labs implementation of the original ZigBee Light Link profile enhancements to the Identify server cluster.  The plugin is only intended to assist with debugging as the implemented callbacks simply parse requests from the Identify client and blink LEDs.  Prior to production, this plugin should be replaced with code that acts on the requests in an appropriate way. Note that the extensions do not now require touchlink commissioning to be used, and that the commands may now be required by other device types, such as Lighting and Occupancy.
