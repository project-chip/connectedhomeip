 *

 * 1. Set the EnergyScanPending Functional Notification flag.
 * 2. Wait until the GSME reads that flag or one GSME wake up period,
 *    whichever comes first.
 * 3. Perform an energy scan and determine the new page and channel.
 * 4. Set the ChannelChangePending Functional Notification flag
 *    and the ChannelChange attribute.
 * 5. Wait until the GSME reads that attribute or two GSME wake up periods,
 *    whichever comes first.
 * 6. Change the channel.
 *
 * Note 1: The GSME must have completed the registration and allocated a mirror
 *  before this function is called.

 * Note 2: emberAfPluginCommsHubFunctionSubGhzChannelChangeCallback() is called
 *  at steps 3 and 6 in the above sequence. After step 3, the application must
