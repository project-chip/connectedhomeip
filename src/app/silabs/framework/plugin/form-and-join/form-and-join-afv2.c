    // The Network Find was another plugin layered on top of the form-and-join library.
    // Any application that used form-and-join without the network-find plugin
    // would need to properly cleanup the form-and-join code.  On the SOC this
    // was done automatically by a timer that fired after 30 seconds, assuming
    // you called emberFormAndJoinTick() regularly.  On the host, there was nno
    // timer and thus an explicit call to emberFormAndJoinCleanup() was required.

    // Now if the network-find plugin was enabled it had its own cleanup
    // (that also called emberFormAndJoinCleanup()), therefore it was
    // unnecessary to schedule an event.

    // only on SOC when it is not disabled by another piece of code
