 * table entry for the server before sending the request. All future
 * communication using the tunnel will be sent using the address table entry.
 * The plugin will call ::emberAfPluginTunnelingClientTunnelOpenedCallback with
 * the status of the request.

 * @param server The network address of the server to which the request will be
 * sent.
 * @param clientEndpoint The local endpoint from which the request will be
 * sent.
 * @param serverEndpoint The remote endpoint to which the request will be sent.
 * @param protocolId The protocol ID of the requested tunnel.
 * @param manufacturerCode The manufacturer code of the requested tunnel.
 * @param flowControlSupport true if flow control support is requested or false
 * if not.  Note: flow control is not currently supported by the Tunneling
 * client or server plugins.
