 * routine should be put into this function.
        Note: No callback in the
 * Application Framework is associated with resource cleanup. If you are
 * implementing your application on a Unix host where resource cleanup is a
 * consideration, we expect that you will use the standard Posix system calls,
 * including the use of atexit() and handlers for signals such as SIGTERM,
 * SIGINT, SIGCHLD, SIGPIPE and so on. If you use the signal() function to
 * register your signal handler, please mind the returned value which may be an
 * Application Framework function. If the return value is non-null, please make
 * sure that you call the returned function from your handler to avoid negating
 * the resource cleanup of the Application Framework itself.
