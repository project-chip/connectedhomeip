// *******************************************************************
// * SeMeterMirror_callbacks.c
// *
// * This file contains all application specific code for the
// * meter mirror sample application. The code is implemented in
// * a series of callbacks which are called from within the
// * application framework. Each callback below includes a
// * comment explaining what it does for the application.
// *
// * This application is inteded to be used along with the
// * gas meter sample application SeMeterGas
// *
// * This application is further explained in the README.txt file which
// * accompanies it in the sample application directory here:
// * /app/framework/sample-apps/se-meter-mirror/README.xml
// *
// * It should also be noted that this application uses some
// * manufacturer specific attributes created by Ember. For instance
// * there was (as of this writing) no SE Mirror server attribute to
// * store the IEEE address of a mirrored device. Noticing this absence
// * we added a manufacturer specific IEEE address. You will notice
// * that every API which deals with the IEEE address of the device
// * being mirrored needs to include the Ember manufacturer code
// * along with it so that it can find the manufacturer specific
// * attribute.
// *
// * The use of a manufacturer specific attribute for IEEE address allows
// * the application to scale better, in the event that you wish to add more
// * mirrors and als to take advantage of the data persistence attribute storage in
// * the application framework.
