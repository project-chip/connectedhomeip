 *

 * attribute was tagged to be stored externally. Function should return

 * from the passed buffer should be stored as the current value of the
 * attribute. Important to note is, that if this method ever returns false,
 * then it is possible to break contract of the write-undivided-attributes
 * global command. That command checks for ranges and attribute existence, but
 * if this method returns false, when the attribute is finally written, then
 * the contract of writing all or no attributes will be broken.
