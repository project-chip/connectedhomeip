# Description of the plugin.
description=This plugin provides an API that can be used for common network managing functionality.  When search functions are called, the plugin will continue to look for a network to join until it either finds a valid network or reaches a plugin option defined maximum amount of rejoin attempts.  On each failed attempt to find a network, it will wait a plugin option defined number of seconds (Network Retry Time) before attempting another search.  Once the plugin has found a network to join, it will handle all action necessary to stay on the network.  This includes a period of short polling necessary for sleepy end device and trying to rejoin the network if the device enters an orphan state.  This plugin also handles all cleanup required after leaving a network, including clearing binding, report, group, and scene tables.
