/** @brief Event Action
 *
 * This function is called by the demand response and load control client
 * plugin whenever an event status changes within the DRLC event table.  The
 * list of possible event status values is defined by the ZCL spec and is
 * listed in the Application Framework's generated enums located in enums.h.
 * For example, an event status may be:
 * AMI_EVENT_STATUS_LOAD_CONTROL_EVENT_COMMAND_RX indicating that a properly
 * formatted event was received; AMI_EVENT_STATUS_EVENT_STARTED indicating
 * that an event has started; AMI_EVENT_STATUS_THE_EVENT_HAS_BEEN_CANCELED,
 * indicating that the event was canceled.  This callback is intended to give
 * the device an opportunity to take action on the event in question.  For
 * instance if an event starts, the device should take the appropriate event
 * action on the hardware.  This callback returns a bool, if returned value
 * is true, then a notification will be send over the air automatically to the
 * originator of the event.  If it is false, then nothing will be sent back to
 * the originator of the event.  Please note that in order for your
 * application to be ZigBee compliant, a notification must be sent over the
 * air to the originator of the event, so a value of false should only be
 * returned if your application code takes care of sending this message or
 * there is some other reason a message does not need to be sent by the
 * framework.
