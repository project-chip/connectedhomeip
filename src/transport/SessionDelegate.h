     *   shift to a new session freely. If an application is holding a session which is not intended to be shifted, it can provide
     *   its shifting policy by overriding GetNewSessionHandlingPolicy in SessionDelegate. For example SessionHolders inside
     *   ExchangeContext and PairingSession are not eligible for auto-shifting.
     *
     * Note: the default implementation orders shifting to the new session, it should be fine for all users, unless the
     *       SessionHolder object is expected to be sticky to a specified session.
     *
     * Note: the implementation MUST NOT modify the session pool or the state of session holders (eg, adding new session, removing
     *       old session) from inside this callback.
