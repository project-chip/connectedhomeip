//
// !!!TEMPORARY CODE!!!
//
// The following code is a temporary implementation of the CHIP Entropy APIs
// that has been specially designed to work around the lack of thread-safety in the
// Nordic port of OpenThread.
//
// In Nordic's OpenThread platform implementation, the code assumes it has exclusive
// access to the underlying entropy source.  In a multi-threaded environment such as
// an CHIP application this precludes code running in other threads from directly
// sourcing entropy.
//
// To work around this, the code here acquires the OpenThread stack lock before interacting
// with the entropy source, effectively blocking all OpenThread activity until CHIP
// has acquired its entropy. Because the entropy is being fed into a DRBG, which then feeds
// the application, this should happen extremely rarely.
//
// Ultimately this code will be revised to use a new thread-safe entropy sourcing API
// provided by Nordic.
