# Contributing as an Open Source Contributor

As an open source contributor you can report bugs and request features in the
[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/issues), as well
as contribute bug fixes and features that do not impact Matter specification as
a pull request. For example: ports of Matter to add APIs to alternative
programming languages (e.g. Java, JS), hardware ports, or an optimized
implementation of existing functionality. For features that impact the
specification, please join Matter work group within the Connectivity Standards
Alliance. The requirements to become an open source contributor of the
[Matter Repository](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip) are:

-   Agree to the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

# Bugs

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by
[submitting a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/issues/new).
The best bug reports provide a detailed description of the issue and
step-by-step instructions for predictably reproducing the issue. Even better,
you can
[submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request)
with a fix.

# New Features

You can request a new feature by
[submitting a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/issues/new).
If you would like to implement a new feature, please consider the scope of the
new feature:

-   _Large feature_: first
    [submit a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/issues/new)
    and communicate your proposal so that the community can review and provide
    feedback. Getting early feedback will help ensure your implementation work
    is accepted by the community. This will also allow us to better coordinate
    our efforts and minimize duplicated effort.
-   _Small feature_: can be implemented and directly
    [submitted as a Pull Request](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#submitting-a-pull-request).

# Contributing Code

Matter follows the "Fork-and-Pull" model for accepting contributions.

### Initial Setup

Setup your GitHub fork and continuous-integration services:

1. Fork the [Matter repository](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip)
   by clicking "Fork" on the web UI.

2. All contributions must pass all checks and reviews to be accepted.

Setup your local development environment:

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone git@github.com:<username>/connectedhomeip.git

# Configure upstream alias
git remote add upstream git@github.com:project-chip/connectedhomeip.git
```

### Submitting a Pull Request

#### Branch

For each new feature, create a working branch:

```bash
# Create a working branch for your new feature
git branch --track <branch-name> origin/master

# Checkout the branch
git checkout <branch-name>
```

#### Create Commits

```bash
# Add each modified file you'd like to include in the commit
git add <file1> <file2>

# Create a commit
git commit
```

This will open up a text editor where you can craft your commit message.

#### Upstream Sync and Clean Up

Prior to submitting your pull request, you might want to do a few things to
clean up your branch and make it as simple as possible for the original
repository's maintainer to test, accept, and merge your work.

If any commits have been made to the upstream master branch, you should rebase
your development branch so that merging it will be a simple fast-forward that
won't require any conflict resolution work.

```bash
# Fetch upstream master and merge with your repository's master branch
git checkout master
git pull upstream master

# If there were any new commits, rebase your development branch
git checkout <branch-name>
git rebase master
```

Now, it may be desirable to squash some of your smaller commits down into a
small number of larger more cohesive commits. You can do this with an
interactive rebase:

```bash
# Rebase all commits on your development branch
git checkout <branch-name>
git rebase -i master
```

This will open up a text editor where you can specify which commits to squash.

#### Push and Test

```bash
# Checkout your branch
git checkout <branch-name>

# Push to your GitHub fork:
git push origin <branch-name>
```

This will trigger the continuous-integration checks. You can view the results in
the respective services. Note that the integration checks will report failures
on occasion.

### Review Requirements

#### Documentation Best Practices

Matter uses Doxygen to markup (or markdown) all C, C++, Objective C, Objective
C++, Perl, Python, and Java code. Read our
[Doxygen Best Practices, Conventions, and Style](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/docs/style/DOXYGEN.adoc)

#### Submit Pull Request

Once you've validated the CI results, go to the page for your fork on GitHub,
select your development branch, and click the pull request button. If you need
to make any adjustments to your pull request, just push the updates to GitHub.
Your pull request will automatically track the changes on your development
branch and update.

#### Merge Requirements

-   Github Workflows pass
-   Builds pass
-   Tests pass
-   Linting passes
-   Code style passes

When can I merge? After these have been satisfied, a reviewer will merge the PR
into master

#### Documentation

Documentation undergoes the same review process as code See the
[Documentation Style Guide](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md)
for more information on how to author and format documentation for contribution.

## Merge Processes

Merges require at least 3 approvals from unique require-reviewers lists, and all
CI tests passing.

### Shorter Reviews

Development Lead & Vice Leads can merge a change with fewer then the required
approvals have been submitted.

A separate "fast track" label will be created that will only require a single
checkbox to be set, this label shall only be set by the Development Lead, and/or
Vice Lead (unless theyâ€™re both unavailable, in which case a replacement can be
temporarily appointed)

"Day" here means "business day" (i.e. PRs on friday do not get fast-tracked
faster).

### Fast track types

### Trivial changes

Small changes or changes that do not affect the main functionality of the code
can be fast tracked immediately. Examples:

-   Adding/removing documentation (.md files)
-   Adding tests (may include small reorganization/method adding/changes to
    enable testability):
    -   certification tests
    -   stability tests
    -   integration tests
    -   functional tests
    -   Test scripts
    -   Additional tests following a pattern (e.g. YAML tests)
-   Adding/updating/fixing tooling to aid in development
-   Re-running code generation
-   Code readability refactors:
    -   renaming enum/classes/structure members
    -   moving constant header location
    -   Obviously trivial build rule changes (e.g. adding missing files to build
        rules)
    -   Changing comments
    -   Adding/removing includes (include what you need and only what you need
        rules)
-   Pulling new third-party repo files
-   Platform vendors/maintainers adding platform features/logic/bug fixes to
    their own platforms
-   Most changes to existing docker files (pulling new versions, reorganizing)
-   Most changes to new dockerfile version in workflows

#### Fast track changes

Larger functionality changes are allowed to be fast tracked with these
requirements/restrictions:

-   Require at least 1 day to have passed since the creation of the PR
-   Require at least 1 checkmark from someone familiar with the code or problem
    space
    -   This requirement shall be dropped after a PR is 3 days old with stale or
        no feedback.
-   Code is sufficiently covered by automated tests (or impossible to
    automatically test with a very solid reason for this - e.g. changes to BLE
    parameters cannot be automatically tested, but should have been manually
    verified)

Fast tracking these changes will involve resolving any obviously 'resolved'
comments (judgment call here: were they replied to or addressed) and merging the
change.

Any "request for changes" marker will always be respected unless obviously
resolved (i.e. author marked "requesting changes because of X and X was done in
the PR")

-   This requirement shall be dropped after a PR is 3 days old with stale or no
    feedback.
