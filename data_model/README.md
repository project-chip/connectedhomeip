## Contents

This folder contains a machine-readable representation of matter clusters.

The XML files inside `clusters` are generated by a `scraper` script out of the
original specification `AsciiDoc` files.

## How to update

The matter specification is not currently public. As such, as script exists to
update the spec XML files, however this is not done automatically.

You will require access to the following tools locally:

-   `scraper`. A binary copy generally available
    [here](https://github.com/csa-data-model/projects/tree/main/DM-Editor/bin/scrape)
-   Specification repository checkout from
    https://github.com/CHIP-Specifications/connectedhomeip-spec

Example usage:

```sh
./scripts/spec_xml/generate_spec_xml.py     \
   --scraper ~/Downloads/scrape-adoc-linux  \
   --spec-root ~/work/connectedhomeip-spec  \
   --output-dir data_model
```
