Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) is equipment used to charge an Electric
Vehicle (EV) or Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle. This cluster provides an
interface to the functionality of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE)
management.

Devices targeted by this cluster include Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment
(EVSE). The cluster generically assumes a signaling protocol (J1772 in NA and
IEC61851 in Europe and Asia) between the EVSE and Electric Vehicle (EV) that
utilizes a pilot signal to manage the states of the charge. SAE J1772 and
IEC61841 define Pilot signal as a modulated DC voltage on a single wire.

Power Line Communication (PLC) is supported by some EVSEs (e.g. for support of
ISO 15118) and may enable features such as Vehicle to Grid (V2G) or Vehicle to
Home (V2H) that allows for bi-directional charging/discharging of electric
vehicles.

More modern EVSE devices may optionally support ISO 15118 to support
bi-directional charging (Vehicle to Grid - V2G) and Plug and Charge
capabilities.

This cluster definition assumes AC charging only. DC charging options may be
added in future revisions of this cluster.

This cluster supports a safety mechanism that may lockout remote operation until
the initial latching conditions have been met. Some of the fault conditions
defined in SAE J1772, such as Ground-Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) or
Charging Circuit Interrupting Device (CCID), may require clearing by an operator
by, for example, pressing a button on the equipment or breaker panel.

Signals and data provided by Electric Vehicle (EV) are labeled using EV in
control and attribute names. Signals and data provided by Electric Vehicle
Supply Equipment (EVSE) are labeled using EVSE in control and attribute names.

This EVSE cluster is written around support of a single EVSE. Having multiple
EVSEs at home or a business is managed by backend system and outside scope of
this cluster.

Note that in many deployments the EVSE may be outside the home and may suffer
from intermittent network connections (e.g. a weak Wi-Fi signal). It also allows
for a charging profile to be pre-configured, in case there is a temporary
communications loss during a charging session.
