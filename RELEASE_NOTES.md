of wireless microcontrollers (MCUs). It contains essential software components,
such as a Bluetooth® Low Energy (BLE) protocol stack supporting Bluetooth 5.2,
Thread 1.3 networking stack based on OpenThread and Matter 1.0 application layer
stack based on open source Matter stack. In addition, the Dynamic Multi-Protocol
Manager (DMM) software component enables multiprotocol development on a single
SimpleLink wireless MCU.

The SimpleLink MCU portfolio offers a single development environment that
delivers flexible hardware, software, and tool options for customers developing
wired and wireless applications. With 100 percent code reuse across host MCUs,
Wi-Fi™, Bluetooth Low Energy, 2.4GHz, Sub-1GHz devices and more, choose the MCU
or connectivity standard that fits your design. A one-time investment with the
SimpleLink software development kit allows you to reuse often, opening the door
to create unlimited applications. For more information, visit
