                only limited by the available heap memory.

                This option can be useful if you encounter static DRAM overflow.

                NOTE: Since there is no cap on pool sizes, this may lead to issues
                where embedded code assumes the pool size is limited, and no other
                mechanisms are in place to restrict the size of allocations.

                NOTE: If enabled and the free heap is exhausted, this may result in
                undefined behavior, potential non-compliance with specifications,
                or failure during certification tests. Even if it passes, it may fail
                to function properly with actual controllers.

                CHIP SDK performs LwIP core locking before calling an LwIP API.
                To make the calls thread safe we have to enable LWIP_TCPIP_CORE_LOCKING.
                Otherwise CHIP SDK will post LwIP APIs to TCPIP task to ensure thread safety.
                Here, we are also enabling LWIP_CHECK_THREAD_SAFETY which will assert when
