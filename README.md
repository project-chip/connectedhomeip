# Current Status of Project Connected Home over IP

The Zigbee Alliance officially opened the Project Connected Home over IP
(Project CHIP) Working Group on January 17 and is in the process of drafting the
specification.

The Projectâ€™s design and technical processes are intended to be open and
transparent to the general public, including to Work Group non-members wherever
possible. The availability of this GitHub repository and its source code under
an Apache v2 license is an important and demonstrable step to achieving this
commitment.

The Project endeavors to bring together the best aspects of market-tested
technologies and to redeploy them as a unified and cohesive whole-system
solution. The overall goal of this approach is to bring the benefits of the
Project to consumers and manufacturers as quickly as possible. As a result, what
you observe in this repository is an implementation-first approach to the
technical specification, vetting integrations in practice.
