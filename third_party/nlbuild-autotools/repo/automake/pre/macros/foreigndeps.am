#
#    Description:
#      This file is the automake header for building foreign make
#      (that is, outside of the current make directory) dependencies.
#
#      This defines placeholder make variables that can and should be
#      overridden by project make files.
#

# The user-supported and -visible variables for foreign make
# dependencies are:
#
#   * NLFOREIGN_FILE_DEPENDENCIES
#
#       A list of absolute or relative file paths to the current directory
#       of the form '<DIR>/<TARGET>' where '$(MAKE) -C <DIR> <TARGET>'
#       will produce and satisfy the desired dependency expected by
#       the current make file.
#
#   * NLFOREIGN_SUBDIR_DEPENDENCIES
#
#       A list of absolute or relative subdirectory paths to the
#       current directory of the form '<DIR>' where '$(MAKE) -C <DIR>
#       <TARGET>' will produce and satisfy the desired dependencies
#       expected by the current make file.
