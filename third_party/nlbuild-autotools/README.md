This project uses nlbuild-autotools (see repo/README.md) as its build
system. The nlbuild-autotools package is inlined into the project to
avoid a bootstrap dependency issue for users who want to build the
project.

# Updating nlbuild-autotools

## Via git subtree

### Initial Add

See "Getting Started" in repo/README.md.

### Subsequent Update

Assuming the project copy of nlbuild-autotools was created with git
subtree, a subsequent update can be accomplished with the following,
replacing HEAD with a named, tagged version if the HEAD commit is not
what is desired.

```
% git subtree pull --prefix=third_party/nlbuild-autotools/repo --squash --message="Update subtree mirror of repository 'https://github.com/nestlabs/nlbuild-autotools.git' branch 'master' at commit 'HEAD'." nlbuild-autotools HEAD
```

The downside of the subtree approach is that some of the subtree state
does not flow along with the project upstream. Consequently, if the
same maintainer is not updating the subtree from the same clone
instance on each update, the update process may be more difficult or
may fail. In addition, any attempt to rebase while a subtree update is
in flight will result in the loss of the subtree.

Finally, subtree is an optional, contributor package in git and is not
included in all git distributions. Consequently, it may not be
available to all maintainers.

## Via git, tar, and Bare File System Operations

For better or worse, the failsafe way to update the project instance
is to do so with git clone, tar, and bare file system operations.

*Clone the Project Repository*

    % git clone https://github.com/nestlabs/nlbuild-autotools.git nlbuild-autotools

*Create an Archive of the nlbuild-autotools Project*

    % git archive --format=tgz `cat .default-version` > nlbuild-autotools-`cat .default-version`.tgz

Replace the `cat .default-version` with HEAD or some other named,
tagged version if you don't want the latest version.

*Clean-out the Existing In-project Copy*

    % cd <this project>
    % rm -rf third_party/nlbuild-autotools/repo/* third_party/nlbuild-autotools/repo/.[a-zA-Z]*

*Overlay the nlbuild-autotools Project Archive*

    % tar --directory=third_party/nlbuild-autotools/repo -zxf <path to nlbuild-autotools-x.y.z.tgz>

*Add New Files and Remove Old Files*

    % git add third_party/nlbuild-autotools/repo
    % git rm `git status -uno -s | sed -n -e '/^ D / { s,^ D \(.\+$\),\1,g; p; }'`

*Commit the Changes*

    % git commit --message="Update subtree mirror of repository 'https://github.com/nestlabs/nlbuild-autotools.git' branch 'master' at commit 'HEAD'." third_party/nlbuild-autotools/repo
