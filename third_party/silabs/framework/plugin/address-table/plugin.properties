# Description of the plugin.
description=This plugin provides support for managing the address table. On SoC, all the action are directly performed on the stack address table. On the HOST it maintains a copy of the address table and ensures that it is always in sync with the NCP's address table. When building for the HOST, the user should take care to make sure that the NCP can support their address table size selected below. This optimal size varies based on platform architecture and size of other dynamically allocated data for this application. If the user sees errors upon reseting the NCP, then it may be because there is not enough room on the NCP to store a very large address table size. If this is not the case, the NCP may not be able to dynamically increase the address table size based on the host's request. You can work around this issue by statically allocating the desired address table size on the zigbee-pro-stack/leaf library plugins on your NCP.
