name=Network Steering

description=This plugin will perform the necesary steps to join the network of any ZigBee Profile.  It tries first to perform a join using an install code using the primary channel mask, and then the secondary channel mask.  If that does not work it then tries to use the default well-known link key (ZigBeeAlliance09) to join on the primary channel mask, and then the secondary channel mask. Finally, if the previous 2 key types fail, the plugin will try to use the distributed security link key (D0D1D2...) to try to join a network on the primary channel mask, and then the secondary channel mask.

channelMask.name=Channel mask
channelMask.description=The channels that the plugin will scan when forming and joining.
channelMask.type=CHANNELS
channelMask.default=0x0318C800UL

radioTxPower.name=Radio output power
radioTxPower.description=The radio output power (in dBm) at which the node will operate.
radioTxPower.type=POWER
radioTxPower.default=3

radioTxCallback.name=Get radio output power from callback
radioTxCallback.description=Use a tx power callback to determine radio tx power.
radioTxCallback.type=BOOLEAN
radioTxCallback.default=false

scanDuration.name=Scan duration exponent
scanDuration.description=The exponent of the number of scan periods, where a scan period is 960 symbols, and a symbol is 16 miscroseconds.  The scan will occur for ((2^duration) + 1) scan periods.
scanDuration.type=NUMBER:0,14
scanDuration.default=4

commissioningTimeS.name=Network steering commissioning time (seconds)
commissioningTimeS.description=The amount of time (in seconds) that a node will open its network when performing network steering for node on a network, or at the end of the network steering process if a node is a router
commissioningTimeS.type=NUMBER:180,255
commissioningTimeS.default=180
# The minimum time here comes from the BDB spec, doc 13-0402.

optimizeScans.name=Optimize scans
optimizeScans.description=When this option is enabled, this plugin begins by scanning all channels, both primary and secondary channels, and caches all the beacons received. Networks are joined using the cached beacons for each network steering state (use install code based key, use well-known key, use distributed key). Enabling this option may reduce the number of scans significantly, since the legacy steering code would scan each channel every time it ran a steering state.
optimizeScans.type=BOOLEAN
optimizeScans.default=true

tryAllKeys.name=Try all keys at once
tryAllKeys.description=When enabled, network steering will attempt to join each network using the install code derived key, centralized key, and distributed key at the same time, rather than trying each key individually. Users that wish to prioritize joining using install code keys should not check this option.
tryAllKeys.type=BOOLEAN
tryAllKeys.default=false
tryAllKeys.dependsOn=optimizeScans
