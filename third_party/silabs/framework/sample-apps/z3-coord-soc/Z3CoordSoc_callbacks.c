 * a consideration, we expect that you will use the standard Posix system
 * calls, including the use of atexit() and handlers for signals such as
 * SIGTERM, SIGINT, SIGCHLD, SIGPIPE and so on. If you use the signal()
 * function to register your signal handler, please mind the returned value
 * which may be an Application Framework function. If the return value is
 * non-null, please make sure that you call the returned function from your
 * handler to avoid negating the resource cleanup of the Application Framework
 * itself.
