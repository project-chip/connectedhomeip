/*! @header     DNS Service Discovery
 *
 * @discussion  This section describes the functions, callbacks, and data structures
 *              that make up the DNS Service Discovery API.
 *
 *              The DNS Service Discovery API is part of Bonjour, Apple's implementation
 *              of zero-configuration networking (ZEROCONF).
 *
 *              Bonjour allows you to register a network service, such as a
 *              printer or file server, so that it can be found by name or browsed
 *              for by service type and domain. Using Bonjour, applications can
 *              discover what services are available on the network, along with
 *              all the information -- such as name, IP address, and port --
 *              necessary to access a particular service.
 *
 *              In effect, Bonjour combines the functions of a local DNS server and
 *              AppleTalk. Bonjour allows applications to provide user-friendly printer
 *              and server browsing, among other things, over standard IP networks.
 *              This behavior is a result of combining protocols such as multicast and
 *              DNS to add new functionality to the network (such as multicast DNS).
 *
 *              Bonjour gives applications easy access to services over local IP
 *              networks without requiring the service or the application to support
 *              an AppleTalk or a Netbeui stack, and without requiring a DNS server
 *              for the local network.

/* _DNS_SD_H contains the mDNSResponder version number for this header file, formatted as follows:
 *   Major part of the build number * 10000 +
 *   minor part of the build number *   100
 * For example, Mac OS X 10.4.9 has mDNSResponder-108.4, which would be represented as
 * version 1080400. This allows C code to do simple greater-than and less-than comparisons:
 * e.g. an application that requires the DNSServiceGetProperty() call (new in mDNSResponder-126) can check:
 *
 *   #if _DNS_SD_H+0 >= 1260000
 *   ... some C code that calls DNSServiceGetProperty() ...
 *   #endif
 *
 * The version defined in this header file symbol allows for compile-time
 * checking, so that C code building with earlier versions of the header file
 * can avoid compile errors trying to use functions that aren't even defined
 * in those earlier versions. Similar checks may also be performed at run-time:
 *  => weak linking -- to avoid link failures if run with an earlier
 *     version of the library that's missing some desired symbol, or
 *  => DNSServiceGetProperty(DaemonVersion) -- to verify whether the running daemon
 *     ("system service" on Windows) meets some required minimum functionality level.

/*! @enum General flags
 * Most DNS-SD API functions and callbacks include a DNSServiceFlags parameter.
 * As a general rule, any given bit in the 32-bit flags field has a specific fixed meaning,
 * regardless of the function or callback being used. For any given function or callback,
 * typically only a subset of the possible flags are meaningful, and all others should be zero.
 * The discussion section for each API call describes which flags are valid for that call
 * and callback. In some cases, for a particular call, it may be that no flags are currently
 * defined, in which case the DNSServiceFlags parameter exists purely to allow future expansion.
 * In all cases, developers should expect that in future releases, it is possible that new flag
 * values will be defined, and write code with this in mind. For example, code that tests
 *     if (flags == kDNSServiceFlagsAdd) ...
 * will fail if, in a future release, another bit in the 32-bit flags field is also set.
 * The reliable way to test whether a particular bit is set is not with an equality test,
 * but with a bitwise mask:
 *     if (flags & kDNSServiceFlagsAdd) ...
 * With the exception of kDNSServiceFlagsValidate, each flag can be valid(be set) 
 * EITHER only as an input to one of the DNSService*() APIs OR only as an output
 * (provide status) through any of the callbacks used. For example, kDNSServiceFlagsAdd
 * can be set only as an output in the callback, whereas the kDNSServiceFlagsIncludeP2P
 * can be set only as an input to the DNSService*() APIs. See comments on kDNSServiceFlagsValidate  
 * defined in enum below.

     * call DNSServiceCreateConnection(&MainRef) to initialize the main DNSServiceRef.
     * For each subsequent operation that is to share that same connection, the client copies
     * the MainRef, and then passes the address of that copy, setting the ShareConnection flag
     * to tell the library that this DNSServiceRef is not a typical uninitialized DNSServiceRef;
     * it's a copy of an existing DNSServiceRef whose connection information should be reused.
     *
     * For example:
     *
     * DNSServiceErrorType error;
     * DNSServiceRef MainRef;

     * ...
     * DNSServiceRefDeallocate(BrowseRef); // Terminate the browse operation
     * DNSServiceRefDeallocate(MainRef);   // Terminate the shared connection
     *
     * Notes:
     *
     * 1. Collective kDNSServiceFlagsMoreComing flag
     * When callbacks are invoked using a shared DNSServiceRef, the
     * kDNSServiceFlagsMoreComing flag applies collectively to *all* active
     * operations sharing the same parent DNSServiceRef. If the MoreComing flag is
     * set it means that there are more results queued on this parent DNSServiceRef,
     * but not necessarily more results for this particular callback function.
     * The implication of this for client programmers is that when a callback
     * is invoked with the MoreComing flag set, the code should update its
     * internal data structures with the new result, and set a variable indicating
     * that its UI needs to be updated. Then, later when a callback is eventually
     * invoked with the MoreComing flag not set, the code should update *all*
     * stale UI elements related to that shared parent DNSServiceRef that need
     * updating, not just the UI elements related to the particular callback
     * that happened to be the last one to be invoked.
     *
     * 2. Canceling operations and kDNSServiceFlagsMoreComing
     * Whenever you cancel any operation for which you had deferred UI updates
     * waiting because of a kDNSServiceFlagsMoreComing flag, you should perform
     * those deferred UI updates. This is because, after cancelling the operation,
     * you can no longer wait for a callback *without* MoreComing set, to tell
     * you do perform your deferred UI updates (the operation has been canceled,
     * so there will be no more callbacks). An implication of the collective
     * kDNSServiceFlagsMoreComing flag for shared connections is that this
     * guideline applies more broadly -- any time you cancel an operation on
     * a shared connection, you should perform all deferred UI updates for all
     * operations sharing that connection. This is because the MoreComing flag
     * might have been referring to events coming for the operation you canceled,
     * which will now not be coming because the operation has been canceled.
     *
     * 3. Only share DNSServiceRef's created with DNSServiceCreateConnection
     * Calling DNSServiceCreateConnection(&ref) creates a special shareable DNSServiceRef.
     * DNSServiceRef's created by other calls like DNSServiceBrowse() or DNSServiceResolve()
     * cannot be shared by copying them and using kDNSServiceFlagsShareConnection.
     *
     * 4. Don't Double-Deallocate
     * Calling DNSServiceRefDeallocate(ref) for a particular operation's DNSServiceRef terminates
     * just that operation. Calling DNSServiceRefDeallocate(ref) for the main shared DNSServiceRef
     * (the parent DNSServiceRef, originally created by DNSServiceCreateConnection(&ref))
     * automatically terminates the shared connection and all operations that were still using it.
     * After doing this, DO NOT then attempt to deallocate any remaining subordinate DNSServiceRef's.
     * The memory used by those subordinate DNSServiceRef's has already been freed, so any attempt
     * to do a DNSServiceRefDeallocate (or any other operation) on them will result in accesses
     * to freed memory, leading to crashes or other equally undesirable results.
     *
     * 5. Thread Safety
     * The dns_sd.h API does not presuppose any particular threading model, and consequently
     * does no locking of its own (which would require linking some specific threading library).
     * If client code calls API routines on the same DNSServiceRef concurrently
     * from multiple threads, it is the client's responsibility to use a mutext
     * lock or take similar appropriate precautions to serialize those calls.

/*
 * Notes on DNS Name Escaping
 *   -- or --
 * "Why is kDNSServiceMaxDomainName 1009, when the maximum legal domain name is 256 bytes?"
 *
 * All strings used in the DNS-SD APIs are UTF-8 strings. Apart from the exceptions noted below,
 * the APIs expect the strings to be properly escaped, using the conventional DNS escaping rules:
 *
 *   '\\' represents a single literal '\' in the name
 *   '\.' represents a single literal '.' in the name
 *   '\ddd', where ddd is a three-digit decimal value from 000 to 255,
 *        represents a single literal byte with that value.
 *   A bare unescaped '.' is a label separator, marking a boundary between domain and subdomain.
 *
 * The exceptions, that do not use escaping, are the routines where the full
 * DNS name of a resource is broken, for convenience, into servicename/regtype/domain.
 * In these routines, the "servicename" is NOT escaped. It does not need to be, since
 * it is, by definition, just a single literal string. Any characters in that string
 * represent exactly what they are. The "regtype" portion is, technically speaking,
 * escaped, but since legal regtypes are only allowed to contain letters, digits,
 * and hyphens, there is nothing to escape, so the issue is moot. The "domain"
 * portion is also escaped, though most domains in use on the public Internet
 * today, like regtypes, don't contain any characters that need to be escaped.
 * As DNS-SD becomes more popular, rich-text domains for service discovery will
 * become common, so software should be written to cope with domains with escaping.
 *
 * The servicename may be up to 63 bytes of UTF-8 text (not counting the C-String
 * terminating NULL at the end). The regtype is of the form _service._tcp or
 * _service._udp, where the "service" part is 1-15 characters, which may be
 * letters, digits, or hyphens. The domain part of the three-part name may be
 * any legal domain, providing that the resulting servicename+regtype+domain
 * name does not exceed 256 bytes.
 *
 * For most software, these issues are transparent. When browsing, the discovered
 * servicenames should simply be displayed as-is. When resolving, the discovered
 * servicename/regtype/domain are simply passed unchanged to DNSServiceResolve().
 * When a DNSServiceResolve() succeeds, the returned fullname is already in
 * the correct format to pass to standard system DNS APIs such as res_query().
 * For converting from servicename/regtype/domain to a single properly-escaped
 * full DNS name, the helper function DNSServiceConstructFullName() is provided.
 *
 * The following (highly contrived) example illustrates the escaping process.
 * Suppose you have an service called "Dr. Smith\Dr. Johnson", of type "_ftp._tcp"
 * in subdomain "4th. Floor" of subdomain "Building 2" of domain "apple.com."
 * The full (escaped) DNS name of this service's SRV record would be:
 * Dr\.\032Smith\\Dr\.\032Johnson._ftp._tcp.4th\.\032Floor.Building\0322.apple.com.
 */


/*
 * Constants for specifying an interface index
 *
 * Specific interface indexes are identified via a 32-bit unsigned integer returned
 * by the if_nametoindex() family of calls.
 *
 * If the client passes 0 for interface index, that means "do the right thing",
 * which (at present) means, "if the name is in an mDNS local multicast domain
 * (e.g. 'local.', '254.169.in-addr.arpa.', '{8,9,A,B}.E.F.ip6.arpa.') then multicast
 * on all applicable interfaces, otherwise send via unicast to the appropriate
 * DNS server." Normally, most clients will use 0 for interface index to
 * automatically get the default sensible behaviour.
 *
 * If the client passes a positive interface index, then for multicast names that
 * indicates to do the operation only on that one interface. For unicast names the
 * interface index is ignored unless kDNSServiceFlagsForceMulticast is also set.
 *
 * If the client passes kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexLocalOnly when registering
 * a service, then that service will be found *only* by other local clients
 * on the same machine that are browsing using kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexLocalOnly
 * or kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexAny.
 * If a client has a 'private' service, accessible only to other processes
 * running on the same machine, this allows the client to advertise that service
 * in a way such that it does not inadvertently appear in service lists on
 * all the other machines on the network.
 *
 * If the client passes kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexLocalOnly when browsing
 * then it will find *all* records registered on that same local machine.
 * Clients explicitly wishing to discover *only* LocalOnly services can
 * accomplish this by inspecting the interfaceIndex of each service reported
 * to their DNSServiceBrowseReply() callback function, and discarding those
 * where the interface index is not kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexLocalOnly.
 *
 * kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexP2P is meaningful only in Browse, QueryRecord, Register,
 * and Resolve operations. It should not be used in other DNSService APIs.
 *
 * - If kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexP2P is passed to DNSServiceBrowse or
 *   DNSServiceQueryRecord, it restricts the operation to P2P.
 *
 * - If kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexP2P is passed to DNSServiceRegister, it is
 *   mapped internally to kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexAny with the kDNSServiceFlagsIncludeP2P
 *   set.
 *
 * - If kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexP2P is passed to DNSServiceResolve, it is
 *   mapped internally to kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexAny with the kDNSServiceFlagsIncludeP2P
 *   set, because resolving a P2P service may create and/or enable an interface whose 
 *   index is not known a priori. The resolve callback will indicate the index of the
 *   interface via which the service can be accessed.
 *
 * If applications pass kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexAny to DNSServiceBrowse
 * or DNSServiceQueryRecord, they must set the kDNSServiceFlagsIncludeP2P flag
 * to include P2P. In this case, if a service instance or the record being queried
 * is found over P2P, the resulting ADD event will indicate kDNSServiceInterfaceIndexP2P
 * as the interface index.

 * (See "Notes on DNS Name Escaping" earlier in this file for more details.)
 * A graphical browser displaying a hierarchical tree-structured view should cut

 *                  invoked with the kDNSServiceFlagsAdd flag set. When Wide-Area
 *                  DNS-SD is in use, it is possible for a single service to get

 *                  DNS domain, and another in a wide-area unicast DNS domain).
 *                  If a successfully-registered name later suffers a name conflict
 *                  or similar problem and has to be deregistered, the callback will
 *                  be invoked with the kDNSServiceFlagsAdd flag not set. The callback
 *                  is *not* invoked in the case where the caller explicitly terminates
 *                  the service registration by calling DNSServiceRefDeallocate(ref);
 *
 * errorCode:       Will be kDNSServiceErr_NoError on success, otherwise will
 *                  indicate the failure that occurred (including name conflicts,
 *                  if the kDNSServiceFlagsNoAutoRename flag was used when registering.)
 *                  Other parameters are undefined if errorCode is nonzero.
 *
 * name:            The service name registered (if the application did not specify a name in
 *                  DNSServiceRegister(), this indicates what name was automatically chosen).
 *
 * regtype:         The type of service registered, as it was passed to the callout.
 *
 * domain:          The domain on which the service was registered (if the application did not

 *                  terminates it by passing this DNSServiceRef to DNSServiceRefDeallocate().
 *

 *                  (the index for a given interface is determined via the if_nametoindex()

 *                  available interfaces. See "Constants for specifying an interface index" for more details.
 *
 * flags:           Indicates the renaming behavior on name conflict (most applications
 *                  will pass 0). See flag definitions above for details.
 *
 * name:            If non-NULL, specifies the service name to be registered.
 *                  Most applications will not specify a name, in which case the computer
 *                  name is used (this name is communicated to the client via the callback).
 *                  If a name is specified, it must be 1-63 bytes of UTF-8 text.
 *                  If the name is longer than 63 bytes it will be automatically truncated
 *                  to a legal length, unless the NoAutoRename flag is set,
 *                  in which case kDNSServiceErr_BadParam will be returned.
 *
 * regtype:         The service type followed by the protocol, separated by a dot
 *                  (e.g. "_ftp._tcp"). The service type must be an underscore, followed
 *                  by 1-15 characters, which may be letters, digits, or hyphens.
 *                  The transport protocol must be "_tcp" or "_udp". New service types
 *                  should be registered at <http://www.dns-sd.org/ServiceTypes.html>.
 *
 *                  Additional subtypes of the primary service type (where a service
 *                  type has defined subtypes) follow the primary service type in a
 *                  comma-separated list, with no additional spaces, e.g.
 *                      "_primarytype._tcp,_subtype1,_subtype2,_subtype3"
 *                  Subtypes provide a mechanism for filtered browsing: A client browsing
 *                  for "_primarytype._tcp" will discover all instances of this type;
 *                  a client browsing for "_primarytype._tcp,_subtype2" will discover only
 *                  those instances that were registered with "_subtype2" in their list of
 *                  registered subtypes.
 *
 *                  The subtype mechanism can be illustrated with some examples using the
 *                  dns-sd command-line tool:
 *
 *                  % dns-sd -R Simple _test._tcp "" 1001 &
 *                  % dns-sd -R Better _test._tcp,HasFeatureA "" 1002 &
 *                  % dns-sd -R Best   _test._tcp,HasFeatureA,HasFeatureB "" 1003 &
 *
 *                  Now:
 *                  % dns-sd -B _test._tcp             # will find all three services
 *                  % dns-sd -B _test._tcp,HasFeatureA # finds "Better" and "Best"
 *                  % dns-sd -B _test._tcp,HasFeatureB # finds only "Best"
 *
 *                  Subtype labels may be up to 63 bytes long, and may contain any eight-
 *                  bit byte values, including zero bytes. However, due to the nature of
 *                  using a C-string-based API, conventional DNS escaping must be used for
 *                  dots ('.'), commas (','), backslashes ('\') and zero bytes, as shown below:
 *
 *                  % dns-sd -R Test '_test._tcp,s\.one,s\,two,s\\three,s\000four' local 123
 *
 *                  When a service is registered, all the clients browsing for the registered
 *                  type ("regtype") will discover it. If the discovery should be
 *                  restricted to a smaller set of well known peers, the service can be
 *                  registered with additional data (group identifier) that is known
 *                  only to a smaller set of peers. The group identifier should follow primary
 *                  service type using a colon (":") as a delimeter. If subtypes are also present,
 *                  it should be given before the subtype as shown below.
 *
 *                  % dns-sd -R _test1 _http._tcp:mygroup1 local 1001 
 *                  % dns-sd -R _test2 _http._tcp:mygroup2 local 1001 
 *                  % dns-sd -R _test3 _http._tcp:mygroup3,HasFeatureA local 1001 
 *
 *                  Now:
 *                  % dns-sd -B _http._tcp:"mygroup1"                # will discover only test1
 *                  % dns-sd -B _http._tcp:"mygroup2"                # will discover only test2
 *                  % dns-sd -B _http._tcp:"mygroup3",HasFeatureA    # will discover only test3
 *                  
 *                  By specifying the group information, only the members of that group are
 *                  discovered.
 *
 *                  The group identifier itself is not sent in clear. Only a hash of the group
 *                  identifier is sent and the clients discover them anonymously. The group identifier
 *                  may be up to 256 bytes long and may contain any eight bit values except comma which
 *                  should be escaped.
 *
 * domain:          If non-NULL, specifies the domain on which to advertise the service.
 *                  Most applications will not specify a domain, instead automatically
 *                  registering in the default domain(s).
 *
 * host:            If non-NULL, specifies the SRV target host name. Most applications
 *                  will not specify a host, instead automatically using the machine's
 *                  default host name(s). Note that specifying a non-NULL host does NOT
 *                  create an address record for that host - the application is responsible
 *                  for ensuring that the appropriate address record exists, or creating it
 *                  via DNSServiceRegisterRecord().
 *
 * port:            The port, in network byte order, on which the service accepts connections.
 *                  Pass 0 for a "placeholder" service (i.e. a service that will not be discovered
 *                  by browsing, but will cause a name conflict if another client tries to
 *                  register that same name). Most clients will not use placeholder services.
 *
 * txtLen:          The length of the txtRecord, in bytes. Must be zero if the txtRecord is NULL.
 *
 * txtRecord:       The TXT record rdata. A non-NULL txtRecord MUST be a properly formatted DNS
 *                  TXT record, i.e. <length byte> <data> <length byte> <data> ...
 *                  Passing NULL for the txtRecord is allowed as a synonym for txtLen=1, txtRecord="",
 *                  i.e. it creates a TXT record of length one containing a single empty string.
 *                  RFC 1035 doesn't allow a TXT record to contain *zero* strings, so a single empty
 *                  string is the smallest legal DNS TXT record.
 *                  As with the other parameters, the DNSServiceRegister call copies the txtRecord
 *                  data; e.g. if you allocated the storage for the txtRecord parameter with malloc()
 *                  then you can safely free that memory right after the DNSServiceRegister call returns.
 *
 * callBack:        The function to be called when the registration completes or asynchronously
 *                  fails. The client MAY pass NULL for the callback -  The client will NOT be notified
 *                  of the default values picked on its behalf, and the client will NOT be notified of any
 *                  asynchronous errors (e.g. out of memory errors, etc.) that may prevent the registration
 *                  of the service. The client may NOT pass the NoAutoRename flag if the callback is NULL.
 *                  The client may still deregister the service at any time via DNSServiceRefDeallocate().
 *
 * context:         An application context pointer which is passed to the callback function
 *                  (may be NULL).
 *
 * return value:    Returns kDNSServiceErr_NoError on success (any subsequent, asynchronous
 *                  errors are delivered to the callback), otherwise returns an error code indicating
 *                  the error that occurred (the callback is never invoked and the DNSServiceRef
 *                  is not initialized).

/* Browse for instances of a service.
 *
 * DNSServiceBrowseReply() Parameters:
 *
 * sdRef:           The DNSServiceRef initialized by DNSServiceBrowse().
 *
 * flags:           Possible values are kDNSServiceFlagsMoreComing and kDNSServiceFlagsAdd.
 *                  See flag definitions for details.
 *
 * interfaceIndex:  The interface on which the service is advertised. This index should
 *                  be passed to DNSServiceResolve() when resolving the service.
 *
 * errorCode:       Will be kDNSServiceErr_NoError (0) on success, otherwise will
 *                  indicate the failure that occurred. Other parameters are undefined if
 *                  the errorCode is nonzero.
 *
 * serviceName:     The discovered service name. This name should be displayed to the user,
 *                  and stored for subsequent use in the DNSServiceResolve() call.
 *
 * regtype:         The service type, which is usually (but not always) the same as was passed
 *                  to DNSServiceBrowse(). One case where the discovered service type may
 *                  not be the same as the requested service type is when using subtypes:
 *                  The client may want to browse for only those ftp servers that allow
 *                  anonymous connections. The client will pass the string "_ftp._tcp,_anon"
 *                  to DNSServiceBrowse(), but the type of the service that's discovered
 *                  is simply "_ftp._tcp". The regtype for each discovered service instance
 *                  should be stored along with the name, so that it can be passed to
 *                  DNSServiceResolve() when the service is later resolved.
 *
 * domain:          The domain of the discovered service instance. This may or may not be the
 *                  same as the domain that was passed to DNSServiceBrowse(). The domain for each
 *                  discovered service instance should be stored along with the name, so that
 *                  it can be passed to DNSServiceResolve() when the service is later resolved.
 *
 * context:         The context pointer that was passed to the callout.

 *
 * flags:           Currently ignored, reserved for future use.
 *
 * interfaceIndex:  If non-zero, specifies the interface on which to browse for services
 *                  (the index for a given interface is determined via the if_nametoindex()
 *                  family of calls.) Most applications will pass 0 to browse on all available
 *                  interfaces. See "Constants for specifying an interface index" for more details.
 *
 * regtype:         The service type being browsed for followed by the protocol, separated by a
 *                  dot (e.g. "_ftp._tcp"). The transport protocol must be "_tcp" or "_udp".
 *                  A client may optionally specify a single subtype to perform filtered browsing:
 *                  e.g. browsing for "_primarytype._tcp,_subtype" will discover only those
 *                  instances of "_primarytype._tcp" that were registered specifying "_subtype"
 *                  in their list of registered subtypes. Additionally, a group identifier may
 *                  also be specified before the subtype e.g., _primarytype._tcp:GroupID, which
 *                  will discover only the members that register the service with GroupID. See
 *                  DNSServiceRegister for more details.
 *
 * domain:          If non-NULL, specifies the domain on which to browse for services.
 *                  Most applications will not specify a domain, instead browsing on the
 *                  default domain(s).
 *
 * callBack:        The function to be called when an instance of the service being browsed for
 *                  is found, or if the call asynchronously fails.
 *
 * context:         An application context pointer which is passed to the callback function
 *                  (may be NULL).
 *
 * return value:    Returns kDNSServiceErr_NoError on success (any subsequent, asynchronous
 *                  errors are delivered to the callback), otherwise returns an error code indicating
 *                  the error that occurred (the callback is not invoked and the DNSServiceRef
 *                  is not initialized).

/* DNSServiceResolve()
 *
 * Resolve a service name discovered via DNSServiceBrowse() to a target host name, port number, and
 * txt record.
 *
 * Note: Applications should NOT use DNSServiceResolve() solely for txt record monitoring - use
 * DNSServiceQueryRecord() instead, as it is more efficient for this task.
 *
 * Note: When the desired results have been returned, the client MUST terminate the resolve by calling
 * DNSServiceRefDeallocate().
 *
 * Note: DNSServiceResolve() behaves correctly for typical services that have a single SRV record
 * and a single TXT record. To resolve non-standard services with multiple SRV or TXT records,
 * DNSServiceQueryRecord() should be used.
 *
 * DNSServiceResolveReply Callback Parameters:
 *
 * sdRef:           The DNSServiceRef initialized by DNSServiceResolve().
 *
 * flags:           Possible values: kDNSServiceFlagsMoreComing
 *
 * interfaceIndex:  The interface on which the service was resolved.
 *
 * errorCode:       Will be kDNSServiceErr_NoError (0) on success, otherwise will
 *                  indicate the failure that occurred. Other parameters are undefined if
 *                  the errorCode is nonzero.
 *
 * fullname:        The full service domain name, in the form <servicename>.<protocol>.<domain>.
 *                  (This name is escaped following standard DNS rules, making it suitable for
 *                  passing to standard system DNS APIs such as res_query(), or to the
 *                  special-purpose functions included in this API that take fullname parameters.
 *                  See "Notes on DNS Name Escaping" earlier in this file for more details.)
 *
 * hosttarget:      The target hostname of the machine providing the service. This name can
 *                  be passed to functions like gethostbyname() to identify the host's IP address.
 *
 * port:            The port, in network byte order, on which connections are accepted for this service.
 *
 * txtLen:          The length of the txt record, in bytes.
 *
 * txtRecord:       The service's primary txt record, in standard txt record format.
 *
 * context:         The context pointer that was passed to the callout.
 *
 * NOTE: In earlier versions of this header file, the txtRecord parameter was declared "const char *"
 * This is incorrect, since it contains length bytes which are values in the range 0 to 255, not -128 to +127.
 * Depending on your compiler settings, this change may cause signed/unsigned mismatch warnings.
 * These should be fixed by updating your own callback function definition to match the corrected
 * function signature using "const unsigned char *txtRecord". Making this change may also fix inadvertent
 * bugs in your callback function, where it could have incorrectly interpreted a length byte with value 250
 * as being -6 instead, with various bad consequences ranging from incorrect operation to software crashes.
 * If you need to maintain portable code that will compile cleanly with both the old and new versions of
 * this header file, you should update your callback function definition to use the correct unsigned value,
 * and then in the place where you pass your callback function to DNSServiceResolve(), use a cast to eliminate
 * the compiler warning, e.g.:
 *   DNSServiceResolve(sd, flags, index, name, regtype, domain, (DNSServiceResolveReply)MyCallback, context);
 * This will ensure that your code compiles cleanly without warnings (and more importantly, works correctly)
 * with both the old header and with the new corrected version.

*
*  NAT Port Mapping
*
*********************************************************************************************/

/* DNSServiceNATPortMappingCreate
 *
 * Request a port mapping in the NAT gateway, which maps a port on the local machine
 * to an external port on the NAT. The NAT should support either PCP, NAT-PMP or the
 * UPnP/IGD protocol for this API to create a successful mapping. Note that this API
 * currently supports IPv4 addresses/mappings only. If the NAT gateway supports PCP and
 * returns an IPv6 address (incorrectly, since this API specifically requests IPv4
 * addresses), the DNSServiceNATPortMappingReply callback will be invoked with errorCode
 * kDNSServiceErr_NATPortMappingUnsupported.
 *
 * The port mapping will be renewed indefinitely until the client process exits, or
 * explicitly terminates the port mapping request by calling DNSServiceRefDeallocate().
 * The client callback will be invoked, informing the client of the NAT gateway's
 * external IP address and the external port that has been allocated for this client.
 * The client should then record this external IP address and port using whatever
 * directory service mechanism it is using to enable peers to connect to it.
 * (Clients advertising services using Wide-Area DNS-SD DO NOT need to use this API
 * -- when a client calls DNSServiceRegister() NAT mappings are automatically created
 * and the external IP address and port for the service are recorded in the global DNS.
 * Only clients using some directory mechanism other than Wide-Area DNS-SD need to use
 * this API to explicitly map their own ports.)
 *
 * It's possible that the client callback could be called multiple times, for example
 * if the NAT gateway's IP address changes, or if a configuration change results in a
 * different external port being mapped for this client. Over the lifetime of any long-lived
 * port mapping, the client should be prepared to handle these notifications of changes
 * in the environment, and should update its recorded address and/or port as appropriate.
 *
 * NOTE: There are two unusual aspects of how the DNSServiceNATPortMappingCreate API works,
 * which were intentionally designed to help simplify client code:
 *
 *  1. It's not an error to request a NAT mapping when the machine is not behind a NAT gateway.
 *     In other NAT mapping APIs, if you request a NAT mapping and the machine is not behind a NAT
 *     gateway, then the API returns an error code -- it can't get you a NAT mapping if there's no
 *     NAT gateway. The DNSServiceNATPortMappingCreate API takes a different view. Working out
 *     whether or not you need a NAT mapping can be tricky and non-obvious, particularly on
 *     a machine with multiple active network interfaces. Rather than make every client recreate
 *     this logic for deciding whether a NAT mapping is required, the PortMapping API does that
 *     work for you. If the client calls the PortMapping API when the machine already has a
 *     routable public IP address, then instead of complaining about it and giving an error,
 *     the PortMapping API just invokes your callback, giving the machine's public address
 *     and your own port number. This means you don't need to write code to work out whether
 *     your client needs to call the PortMapping API -- just call it anyway, and if it wasn't
 *     necessary, no harm is done:
 *
 *     - If the machine already has a routable public IP address, then your callback
 *       will just be invoked giving your own address and port.
 *     - If a NAT mapping is required and obtained, then your callback will be invoked
 *       giving you the external address and port.
 *     - If a NAT mapping is required but not obtained from the local NAT gateway,
 *       or the machine has no network connectivity, then your callback will be
 *       invoked giving zero address and port.
 *
 *  2. In other NAT mapping APIs, if a laptop computer is put to sleep and woken up on a new
 *     network, it's the client's job to notice this, and work out whether a NAT mapping
 *     is required on the new network, and make a new NAT mapping request if necessary.
 *     The DNSServiceNATPortMappingCreate API does this for you, automatically.
 *     The client just needs to make one call to the PortMapping API, and its callback will
 *     be invoked any time the mapping state changes. This property complements point (1) above.
 *     If the client didn't make a NAT mapping request just because it determined that one was
 *     not required at that particular moment in time, the client would then have to monitor
 *     for network state changes to determine if a NAT port mapping later became necessary.
 *     By unconditionally making a NAT mapping request, even when a NAT mapping not to be
 *     necessary, the PortMapping API will then begin monitoring network state changes on behalf of
 *     the client, and if a NAT mapping later becomes necessary, it will automatically create a NAT
 *     mapping and inform the client with a new callback giving the new address and port information.
 *

 * ...
 * memcpy(myval1, val1ptr, len1);
 * memcpy(myval2, val2ptr, len2);
 * ...
 * return;
 *
 * If you wish to retain the values after return from the DNSServiceResolve()
 * callback, then you need to copy the data to your own storage using memcpy()
 * or similar, as shown in the example above.
 *
 * If for some reason you need to parse a TXT record you built yourself
 * using the TXT record construction functions above, then you can do
 * that using TXTRecordGetLength and TXTRecordGetBytesPtr calls:
 * TXTRecordGetValue(TXTRecordGetLength(x), TXTRecordGetBytesPtr(x), key, &len);
 *
 * Most applications only fetch keys they know about from a TXT record and
 * ignore the rest.
 * However, some debugging tools wish to fetch and display all keys.
 * To do that, use the TXTRecordGetCount() and TXTRecordGetItemAtIndex() calls.

/*
 * DNSServiceSetDispatchQueue
 *
 * Allows you to schedule a DNSServiceRef on a serial dispatch queue for receiving asynchronous
 * callbacks.  It's the clients responsibility to ensure that the provided dispatch queue is running.
 *
 * A typical application that uses CFRunLoopRun or dispatch_main on its main thread will
 * usually schedule DNSServiceRefs on its main queue (which is always a serial queue)
 * using "DNSServiceSetDispatchQueue(sdref, dispatch_get_main_queue());"
 *
 * If there is any error during the processing of events, the application callback will
 * be called with an error code. For shared connections, each subordinate DNSServiceRef
 * will get its own error callback. Currently these error callbacks only happen
 * if the mDNSResponder daemon is manually terminated or crashes, and the error
 * code in this case is kDNSServiceErr_ServiceNotRunning. The application must call
 * DNSServiceRefDeallocate to free the DNSServiceRef when it gets such an error code.
 * These error callbacks are rare and should not normally happen on customer machines,
 * but application code should be written defensively to handle such error callbacks
 * gracefully if they occur.
 *
 * After using DNSServiceSetDispatchQueue on a DNSServiceRef, calling DNSServiceProcessResult
 * on the same DNSServiceRef will result in undefined behavior and should be avoided.
 *
 * Once the application successfully schedules a DNSServiceRef on a serial dispatch queue using
 * DNSServiceSetDispatchQueue, it cannot remove the DNSServiceRef from the dispatch queue, or use
 * DNSServiceSetDispatchQueue a second time to schedule the DNSServiceRef onto a different serial dispatch
 * queue. Once scheduled onto a dispatch queue a DNSServiceRef will deliver events to that queue until
 * the application no longer requires that operation and terminates it using DNSServiceRefDeallocate.
 *
 * service:         DNSServiceRef that was allocated and returned to the application, when the
 *                  application calls one of the DNSService API.
 *
 * queue:           dispatch queue where the application callback will be scheduled
 *
 * return value:    Returns kDNSServiceErr_NoError on success.
 *                  Returns kDNSServiceErr_NoMemory if it cannot create a dispatch source
 *                  Returns kDNSServiceErr_BadParam if the service param is invalid or the
