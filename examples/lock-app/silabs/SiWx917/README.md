## Introduction

The EFR32 lock example provides a baseline demonstration of a door lock control
device, built using Matter and the Silicon Labs gecko SDK. It can be controlled
by a Chip controller over an Openthread or Wifi network..

The EFR32 device can be commissioned over Bluetooth Low Energy where the device
and the Chip controller will exchange security information with the Rendez-vous
procedure. If using Thread, Thread Network credentials are then provided to the
EFR32 device which will then join the Thread network.

If the LCD is enabled, the LCD on the Silabs WSTK shows a QR Code containing the
needed commissioning information for the BLE connection and starting the
Rendez-vous procedure.

The lighting example is intended to serve both as a means to explore the
workings of Matter as well as a template for creating real products based on the
Silicon Labs platform.

<a name="flashing"></a>

## Flashing the Application

-   On the command line:

          ```
          $ cd ~/connectedhomeip/examples/lock-app/efr32
          $ python3 out/debug/chip-efr32-lock-example.flash.py
          ```

-   Or with the Ozone debugger, just load the .out file.

<a name="view-logging"></a>

## Viewing Logging Output

The example application is built to use the SEGGER Real Time Transfer (RTT)
facility for log output. RTT is a feature built-in to the J-Link Interface MCU
on the WSTK development board. It allows bi-directional communication with an
embedded application without the need for a dedicated UART.

Using the RTT facility requires downloading and installing the _SEGGER J-Link
Software and Documentation Pack_
([web site](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack)).

Alternatively, SEGGER Ozone J-Link debugger can be used to view RTT logs too
after flashing the .out file.

-   Download the J-Link installer by navigating to the appropriate URL and
    agreeing to the license agreement.

-   [JLink_Linux_x86_64.deb](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/JLink_Linux_x86_64.deb)
-   [JLink_MacOSX.pkg](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/JLink_MacOSX.pkg)

*   Install the J-Link software

          ```
          $ cd ~/Downloads
          $ sudo dpkg -i JLink_Linux_V*_x86_64.deb
          ```

*   In Linux, grant the logged in user the ability to talk to the development
    hardware via the linux tty device (/dev/ttyACMx) by adding them to the
    dialout group.

          ```
          $ sudo usermod -a -G dialout ${USER}
          ```

Once the above is complete, log output can be viewed using the JLinkExe tool in
combination with JLinkRTTClient as follows:

-   Run the JLinkExe tool with arguments to autoconnect to the WSTK board:

    For MG12 use:

          ```
          $ JLinkExe -device EFR32MG12PXXXF1024 -if JTAG -speed 4000 -autoconnect 1
          ```

    For MG21 use:

          ```
          $ JLinkExe -device EFR32MG21AXXXF1024 -if SWD -speed 4000 -autoconnect 1
          ```

-   In a second terminal, run the JLinkRTTClient to view logs:

          ```
          $ JLinkRTTClient
          ```

## Running the Complete Example

-   It is assumed here that you already have an OpenThread border router
    configured and running. If not see the following guide
    [Openthread_border_router](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/docs/guides/openthread_border_router_pi.md)
    for more information on how to setup a border router on a raspberryPi.

    Take note that the RCP code is available directly through
    [Simplicity Studio 5](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/simplicity-studio/simplicity-studio-5)
    under File->New->Project Wizard->Examples->Thread : ot-rcp

-   User interface : **LCD** The LCD on Silabs WSTK shows a QR Code. This QR
    Code is be scanned by the CHIP Tool app For the Rendez-vous procedure over
    BLE

        * On devices that do not have or support the LCD Display like the BRD4166A Thunderboard Sense 2,
          a URL can be found in the RTT logs.

          <info  > [SVR] Copy/paste the below URL in a browser to see the QR Code:
          <info  > [SVR] https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=CH%3AI34NM%20-00%200C9SS0

    **LED 0** shows the overall state of the device and its connectivity. The
    following states are possible:

        -   _Short Flash On (50 ms on/950 ms off)_ ; The device is in the
            unprovisioned (unpaired) state and is waiting for a commissioning
            application to connect.

        -   _Rapid Even Flashing_ ; (100 ms on/100 ms off)_ &mdash; The device is in the
            unprovisioned state and a commissioning application is connected through
            Bluetooth LE.

        -   _Short Flash Off_ ; (950ms on/50ms off)_ &mdash; The device is fully
            provisioned, but does not yet have full Thread network or service
            connectivity.

        -   _Solid On_ ; The device is fully provisioned and has full Thread
            network and service connectivity.

    **LED 1** Simulates the Lock The following states are possible:

        -   _Solid On_ ; Bolt is unlocked
        -   _Blinking_ ; Bolt is moving to the desired state
        -   _Off_ ; Bolt is locked

    **Push Button 0**

        -   _Press and Release_ : Start, or restart, BLE advertisement in fast mode. It will advertise in this mode
            for 30 seconds. The device will then switch to a slower interval advertisement.
            After 15 minutes, the advertisement stops.

        -   _Pressed and hold for 6 s_ : Initiates the factory reset of the device.
            Releasing the button within the 6-second window cancels the factory reset
            procedure. **LEDs** blink in unison when the factory reset procedure is
            initiated.

    **Push Button 1** Toggles the bolt state On/Off

-   You can provision and control the Chip device using the python controller,
    Chip tool standalone, Android or iOS app

    [CHIPTool](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/examples/chip-tool/README.md)

Here is some CHIPTool examples:

    Pairing with chip-tool:
    ```
    chip-tool pairing ble-thread 1 hex:<operationalDataset> 20202021 3840
    ```

    Set a user:
    ```
    ./out/chip-tool doorlock set-user OperationType UserIndex UserName UserUniqueId UserStatus UserType CredentialRule node-id/group-id
    ./out/chip-tool doorlock set-user 0 1 "mike" 5 1 0 0 1 1 --timedInteractionTimeoutMs 1000
    ```

    Set a credential:
    ```
    ./out/chip-tool doorlock set-credential OperationType Credential CredentialData UserIndex UserStatus UserType node-id/group-id
    ./out/chip-tool doorlock set-credential 0 '{ "credentialType": 1, "credentialIndex": 1 }' "123456" 1 null null 1 1 --timedInteractionTimeoutMs 1000
    ```

    Changing a credential:
    ```
    ./out/chip-tool doorlock set-credential OperationType Credential CredentialData UserIndex UserStatus UserType node-id/group-id
    ./out/chip-tool doorlock set-credential 2 '{ "credentialType": 1, "credentialIndex": 1 }' "123457" 1 null null 1 1 --timedInteractionTimeoutMs 1000
    ```

    Get a user:
    ```
    ./out/chip-tool doorlock get-user UserIndex node-id/group-id
    ./out/chip-tool doorlock get-user 1 1 1
    ```

    Unlock door:
    ```
    ./out/chip-tool doorlock unlock-door node-id/group-id
    ./out/chip-tool doorlock unlock-door 1 1 --timedInteractionTimeoutMs 1000
    ```

    Lock door:
    ```
    ./out/chip-tool doorlock lock-door node-id/group-id
    ./out/chip-tool doorlock lock-door 1 1 --timedInteractionTimeoutMs 1000
    ```

### Notes

-   Depending on your network settings your router might not provide native ipv6
    addresses to your devices (Border router / PC). If this is the case, you
    need to add a static ipv6 addresses on both device and then an ipv6 route to
    the border router on your PC

#On Border Router: \$ sudo ip addr add dev <Network interface> 2002::2/64

#On PC(Linux): \$ sudo ip addr add dev <Network interface> 2002::1/64

#Add Ipv6 route on PC(Linux) \$ sudo ip route add <Thread global ipv6 prefix>/64
via 2002::2

## Memory settings

While most of the RAM usage in CHIP is static, allowing easier debugging and
optimization with symbols analysis, we still need some HEAP for the crypto and
OpenThread. Size of the HEAP can be modified by changing the value of the
`configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE` define inside of the FreeRTOSConfig.h file of this
example. Please take note that a HEAP size smaller than 13k can and will cause a
Mbedtls failure during the BLE rendez-vous or CASE session

To track memory usage you can set `enable_heap_monitoring = true` either in the
BUILD.gn file or pass it as a build argument to gn. This will print on the RTT
console the RAM usage of each individual task and the number of Memory
allocation and Free. While this is not extensive monitoring you're welcome to
modify `examples/platform/efr32/MemMonitoring.cpp` to add your own memory
tracking code inside the `trackAlloc` and `trackFree` function
