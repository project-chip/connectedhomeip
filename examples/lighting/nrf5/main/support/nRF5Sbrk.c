/**
 *  Alternate implementation of _sbrk() for use with gcc on nRF5 platforms.
 *
 *  The default implementation of _sbrk() that comes with the GCC ARM toolchain
 *  (based on the newlib C library) is ill suited for use on RTOS-based embedded
 *  systems. In particular, the heap size limit check makes assumptions about
 *  the relative ordering in memory of the stack and heap that don't always hold
 *  true when _sbrk() is called from an RTOS task.
 *
 *  This implementation uses the __HeapBase and __HeapLimit definitions declared
 *  in the Nordic GCC startup code (e.g. see gcc_startup_nrf52840.S) to properly
 *  limit the max heap size to the configured value.
