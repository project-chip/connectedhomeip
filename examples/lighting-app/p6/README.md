## Introduction

The P6 lighting example provides a baseline demonstration of a Light control
device, built using Matter and the Infineon Modustoolbox SDK. It can be
controlled by Matter controller over Wi-Fi network.

The P6 device can be commissioned over Bluetooth Low Energy where the device and
the Matter controller will exchange security information with the Rendezvous
procedure. Wi-Fi Network credentials are then provided to the P6 device which
will then join the network.

## Building

-   [Modustoolbox Software](https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox)

    Refer to `integrations/docker/images/chip-build-infineon/Dockerfile` or
    `scripts/examples/gn_p6_example.sh` for downloading the Software and related
    tools.

-   Install some additional tools (likely already present for Matter
    developers): \$ sudo apt install gcc g++ clang ninja-build python
    python3-venv libssl-dev libavahi-client-dev libglib2.0-dev git cmake
    python3-pip

-   Supported hardware:
    [CY8CKIT-062S2-43012](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-062S2-43012)

*   Build the example application:

          $ ./scripts/examples/gn_p6_example.shÂ ./examples/lighting-app/p6 out/lighting_app_p6

-   To delete generated executable, libraries and object files use:

          $ cd ~/connectedhomeip
          $ rm -rf out/

<a name="flashing"></a>

## Flashing the Application

-   Put CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 board on KitProg3 CMSIS-DAP Mode by pressing the
    `MODE SELECT` button. `KITPROG3 STATUS` LED is ON confirms board is in
    proper mode.

-   On the command line:

          $ cd ~/connectedhomeip
          $ python3 out/lighting_app_p6/chip-p6-lock-example.flash.py

## Commissioning and cluster control

Commissioning can be carried out using BLE.

<a name="Setting up Python Controller"></a>

### Setting up Python Controller

Once P6 is up and running, we need to set up a device controller on Raspberry Pi
4 to perform commissioning and cluster control.

-   Set up python controller.

           $ cd {path-to-connectedhomeip}
           $ ./scripts/build_python.sh -m platform

-   Execute the controller.

           $ source ./out/python_env/bin/activate
           $ chip-device-ctrl

<a name="Commissioning over BLE"></a>

### Commissioning over BLE

-   Establish the secure session over BLE.

         - chip-device-ctrl > ble-scan
         - chip-device-ctrl > connect -ble 3840 20202021 1234

         Parameters:
         1. Discriminator: 3840
         2. Setup-pin-code: 20202021
         3. Node ID: Optional.
            If not passed in this command, then it is auto-generated by the controller and
            displayed in the output of connect.
            The same value should be used in the next commands.
            We have chosen a random node ID which is 1234.

-   Add credentials of the Wi-Fi network you want the P6 to connect to, using
    the `AddWiFiNetwork` command and then enable the P6 to connect to it using
    `EnableWiFiNetwork` command. In this example, we have used `WIFI_SSID` and
    `WIFI_PASSWORD` as the SSID and passphrase respectively.

         - chip-device-ctrl > zcl NetworkCommissioning AddWiFiNetwork 1234 0 0 ssid=str:WIFI_SSID credentials=str:WIFI_PASSWORD breadcrumb=0 timeoutMs=1000

         - chip-device-ctrl > zcl NetworkCommissioning EnableNetwork 1234 0 0 networkID=str:WIFI_SSID breadcrumb=0 timeoutMs=1000

-   Close the BLE connection to P6, as it is not required hereafter.

         - chip-device-ctrl > close-ble

-   Resolve DNS-SD name and update address of the node in the device controller.

         - chip-device-ctrl > resolve 1234

#### Notes

Raspberry Pi 4 BLE connection issues can be avoided by running the following
commands. These power cycle the BlueTooth hardware and disable BR/EDR mode.

          $ sudo btmgmt -i hci0 power off
          $ sudo btmgmt -i hci0 bredr off
          $ sudo btmgmt -i hci0 power on

<a name="Cluster control"></a>

### Cluster control

-   After successful commissioning, use the OnOff cluster command to toggle
    device between On or Off states.

    `chip-device-ctrl > zcl OnOff Off 1234 1 0`

    `chip-device-ctrl > zcl OnOff On 1234 1 0`

-   Cluster OnOff can also be done using the `USER_BTN1` button on the board.
    This button is configured with `APP_LIGHT_BUTTON` in `include/AppConfig.h`.
    Press `USER_BTN1` on the board to toggle between Light ON and OFF states.
    Light ON and OFF can be observed with 'LED9' on the board. This LED is
    configured with `LIGHT_LED` in `include/AppConfig.h`.
