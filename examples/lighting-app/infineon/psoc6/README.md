## Introduction

The PSoC6 lighting example provides a baseline demonstration of a Light control
device, built using Matter and the Infineon Modustoolbox SDK. It can be
controlled by Matter controller over Wi-Fi network.

The PSoC6 device can be commissioned over Bluetooth Low Energy where the device
and the Matter controller will exchange security information with the Rendezvous
procedure. Wi-Fi Network credentials are then provided to the PSoC6 device which
will then join the network.

## Building

-   [Modustoolbox Software](https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox)

    Refer to `integrations/docker/images/chip-build-infineon/Dockerfile` or
    `scripts/examples/gn_psoc6_example.sh` for downloading the Software and
    related tools.

-   Install some additional tools (likely already present for Matter
    developers): \$ sudo apt install gcc g++ clang ninja-build python
    python3-venv libssl-dev libavahi-client-dev libglib2.0-dev git cmake
    python3-pip

-   Supported hardware:
    [CY8CKIT-062S2-43012](https://www.cypress.com/CY8CKIT-062S2-43012)

*   Build the example application:

          $ source scripts/activate.sh
          $ scripts/build/build_examples.py --no-log-timestamps --target 'infineon-psoc6-light' build

-   To delete generated executable, libraries and object files use:

          $ cd ~/connectedhomeip
          $ rm -rf out/

<a name="flashing"></a>

## Flashing the Application

-   Put CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 board on KitProg3 CMSIS-DAP Mode by pressing the
    `MODE SELECT` button. `KITPROG3 STATUS` LED is ON confirms board is in
    proper mode.

-   On the command line:

          $ cd ~/connectedhomeip
          $ python3 out/infineon-psoc6-light/chip-psoc6-lighting-example.flash.py

<a name="Commissioning and cluster control"></a>

## Commissioning and cluster control

Commissioning can be carried out using BLE.

<a name="Setting up chip-tool"></a>

### Setting up Chip tool

Once PSoC6 is up and running, we need to set up chip-tool on Raspberry Pi 4 to
perform commissioning and cluster control.

-   Set up python controller.

           $ cd {path-to-connectedhomeip}
           $ ./scripts/examples/gn_build_example.sh examples/chip-tool out/debug

-   Execute the controller.

           $ ./out/debug/chip-tool

<a name="Commissioning over BLE"></a>

### Commissioning over BLE

Run the built executable and pass it the discriminator and pairing code of the
remote device, as well as the network credentials to use.

         $ ./out/debug/chip-tool pairing ble-wifi 1234 ${SSID} ${PASSWORD} 20202021 3840

         Parameters:
         1. Discriminator: 3840
         2. Setup-pin-code: 20202021
         3. Node ID: 1234 (you can assign any node id)
         4. SSID : Wi-Fi SSID
         5. PASSWORD : Wi-Fi Password

<a name="Notes"></a>

#### Notes

Raspberry Pi 4 BLE connection issues can be avoided by running the following
commands. These power cycle the BlueTooth hardware and disable BR/EDR mode.

          $ sudo btmgmt -i hci0 power off
          $ sudo btmgmt -i hci0 bredr off
          $ sudo btmgmt -i hci0 power on

<a name="Cluster control"></a>

### Cluster control

-   After successful commissioning, use the OnOff cluster command to toggle
    device between On or Off states.

    `$ ./out/debug/chip-tool onoff on 1234 1`

    `$ ./out/debug/chip-tool onoff off 1234 1`

-   Cluster OnOff can also be done using the `USER_BTN1` button on the board.
    This button is configured with `APP_LIGHT_BUTTON` in `include/AppConfig.h`.
    Press `USER_BTN1` on the board to toggle between Light ON and OFF states.
    Light ON and OFF can be observed with 'LED9' on the board. This LED is
    configured with `LIGHT_LED` in `include/AppConfig.h`.

### Factory Reset

-   Commissioned Wi-Fi Credentials can be cleared by pressing `USER_BTN2` button
    on the board. All the data configured on the device during the initial
    commissioning will be deleted and device will be ready for commissioning
    again.

-   Pressing the button again within 5 seconds will cancel the factory reset of
    the board.
