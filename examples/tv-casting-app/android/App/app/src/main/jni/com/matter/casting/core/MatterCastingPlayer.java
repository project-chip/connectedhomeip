   * @brief Verifies that a connection exists with this CastingPlayer, or triggers a new

   *     (UDC) process by sending an IdentificationDeclaration message to the Commissioner. For
   *     certain UDC features, where a Commissioner reply is expected, this API needs to be followed
   *     up with the continueConnecting() API defiend below. See the Matter UDC specification or
   *     parameter class definitions for details on features not included in the description below.
   * @param connectionCallbacks contains the onSuccess (Required), onFailure (Required) and
   *     onCommissionerDeclaration (Optional) callbacks defiend in ConnectCallbacks.java.
   *     <p>For example: During CastingPlayer/Commissioner-Generated passcode commissioning, the
   *     Commissioner replies with a CommissionerDeclaration message with PasscodeDialogDisplayed
   *     and CommissionerPasscode set to true. Given these Commissioner state details, the client is
   *     expected to perform some actions, detailed in the continueConnecting() API below, and then
   *     call the continueConnecting() API to complete the process.
   * @param commissioningWindowTimeoutSec (Optional) time (in sec) to keep the commissioning window
   *     open, if commissioning is required. Needs to be >= kCommissioningWindowTimeoutSec.
   * @param idOptions (Optional) Parameters in the IdentificationDeclaration message sent by the
   *     Commissionee to the Commissioner. These parameters specify the information relating to the
   *     requested commissioning session.
   *     <p>For example: To invoke the CastingPlayer/Commissioner-Generated passcode commissioning
   *     flow, the client would call this API with IdentificationDeclarationOptions containing
   *     CommissionerPasscode set to true. See IdentificationDeclarationOptions.java for a complete
   *     list of optional parameters.
   *     <p>Furthermore, attributes (such as VendorId) describe the TargetApp that the client wants
   *     to interact with after commissioning. If this value is passed in,
   *     verifyOrEstablishConnection() will force UDC, in case the desired TargetApp is not found in
   *     the on-device CastingStore.

   *     PasscodeDialogDisplayed and CommissionerPasscode set to true.
   *     <p>4. Client has handled the Commissioner's CommissionerDecelration message.
   *     <p>5. Client prompted user to input Passcode from Commissioner.
   *     <p>6. Client has updated the CastingApp's AppParameters DataProvider<CommissionableData>

   *     setupPasscode, int discriminator). This allows continueConnecting() to update the
