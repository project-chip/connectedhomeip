 *     (UDC) process by sending an IdentificationDeclaration message to the Commissioner. For
 *     certain UDC features, where a Commissioner reply is expected, this API needs to be followed
 *     up with the continueConnecting() API defiend below. See the Matter UDC specification or
 *     parameter class definitions for details on features not included in the description below.
 * @param connectionCallbacks contains the connectionCompleteCallback (Required) and
 *     commissionerDeclarationCallback (Optional) callbacks defiend in MCConnectionCallbacks.
 *     <p>For example: During CastingPlayer/Commissioner-Generated passcode commissioning, the
 *     Commissioner replies with a CommissionerDeclaration message with PasscodeDialogDisplayed
 *     and CommissionerPasscode set to true. Given these Commissioner state details, the client is
 *     expected to perform some actions, detailed in the continueConnecting() API below, and then
 *     call the continueConnecting() API to complete the process.
 * @param timeout time (in sec) to keep the commissioning window open, if commissioning is required.
 *     Needs to be >= MCCastingPlayer.kMinCommissioningWindowTimeoutSec.
 * @param identificationDeclarationOptions (Optional) Parameters in the IdentificationDeclaration
 *     message sent by the Commissionee to the Commissioner. These parameters specify the
 *     information relating to the requested commissioning session.
 *     <p>For example: To invoke the CastingPlayer/Commissioner-Generated passcode commissioning
 *     flow, the client would call this API with IdentificationDeclarationOptions containing
 *     CommissionerPasscode set to true. See IdentificationDeclarationOptions.java for a complete
 *     list of optional parameters.
 *     <p>Furthermore, attributes (such as VendorId) describe the TargetApp/Endpoint that the client
 *     wants to interact with after commissioning. If this value is passed in,
 *     verifyOrEstablishConnection() will force UDC, in case the desired TargetApp is not found in
 *     the on-device cached information/CastingStore.
