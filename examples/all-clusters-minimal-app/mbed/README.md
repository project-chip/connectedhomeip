<h1> Matter Arm Mbed OS All Clusters Example Application </h1>

The Arm Mbed OS All Clusters Example demonstrates device commissioning process
and all available clusters control.

You can use this example as a reference for creating your own application.

The example is based on
[Matter](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip) and Arm Mbed OS, and
supports remote access and control of device over a WiFi network.

The example behaves as a Matter accessory, in other words a device that can be
paired into an existing Matter network and can be controlled by this network.

# Overview

The Matter device that runs the All Clusters application is controlled by the
Matter controller device over WiFi. By default, the Matter device is
disconnected, and it should be paired with Matter controller and get
configuration from it. Actions required before establishing full communication
are described below.

## Bluetooth Low Energy advertising

To commission the device onto a Matter network, the device must be discoverable
over BLE. The BLE advertising starts automatically after device boot-up.

## Bluetooth Low Energy rendezvous

In Matter, the commissioning procedure (called rendezvous) is done over BLE
between a Matter device and the Matter controller, where the controller has the
commissioner role.

To start the rendezvous, the controller must get the commissioning information
from the Matter device. The data payload is encoded within a QR code, printed to
the UART console.

## WiFi provisioning

The last part of the rendezvous procedure, provisioning involves sending the
network credentials from the Matter controller to the Matter device. As a
result, device is able to join the network and communicate with other devices in
the network.

# Run application

## Environment setup

Before building the example, check out the Matter repository and sync submodules
using the following command:

    $ git submodule update --init

Building the example application requires the use of **ARM Mbed-OS** sources and
the **arm-none-gnu-eabi** toolchain.

The Cypress OpenOCD package is required for flashing purpose. Install the
Cypress OpenOCD and set env var `OPENOCD_PATH` before calling the flashing
script.

```
cd ~
wget https://github.com/Infineon/openocd/releases/download/release-v4.3.0/openocd-4.3.0.1746-linux.tar.gz
tar xzvf openocd-4.3.0.1746-linux.tar.gz
export OPENOCD_PATH=$HOME/openocd
```

Some additional packages may be needed, depending on selected build target and
its requirements.

> **The VSCode devcontainer has these components pre-installed. Using the VSCode
> devcontainer is the recommended way to interact with Arm Mbed-OS port of the
> Matter Project.**
>
> **Please read this [README.md](../../..//docs/VSCODE_DEVELOPMENT.md) for more
> information about using VSCode in container.**

To initialize the development environment, download all registered sub-modules
and activate the environment:

```
$ source ./scripts/bootstrap.sh
$ source ./scripts/activate.sh
```

If packages are already installed then you just need to activate the development
environment:

```
$ source ./scripts/activate.sh
```

## Building

The All Clusters application can be built in the same way as any other Matter
example ported to the mbed-os platform.

-   **by using generic vscode task**:

```
Command Palette (F1) => Run Task... => Run Mbed Application => build => all-clusters-minimal-app => (board name) => (build profile) => (build type)
```

-   **by calling explicitly building script:**

```
${MATTER_ROOT}/scripts/examples/mbed_example.sh -c=build -a=all-clusters-minimal-app -b=<board name> -p=<build profile> -T=<build type>
```

Both approaches are limited to supported evaluation boards which are listed in
[Supported devices](#supported_devices) paragraph.

Mbed OS defines three building profiles: _develop, debug_ and _release_. For
more details please visit
[ARM Mbed OS build profiles](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/program-setup/build-profiles-and-rules.html).

There are also three types of built application: _simple, boot_ and _upgrade_:

-   **simple** - standalone application, mainly for developing and testing
    purpose (all building profiles are supported)
-   **boot** - signed application + bootloader, it supports booting process and
    can be use for firmware update (only _release_ building profiles is
    supported)
-   **update** - signed application, application image can be used for firmware
    update (only _release_ building profiles is supported)

When using the building script, it is possible expand the list of acceptable
targets; this may be useful for rapid testing of a new mbed-targets.

## Flashing

The All Clusters application can be flashed in the same way as any other Matter
example ported to mbed-os platform.

The [Open On-Chip Debugger](http://openocd.org/) is used to upload a binary
image and reset the device.

-   **by using VSCode task**:

```
Command Palette (F1) => Run Task... -> Run Mbed Application => flash => all-clusters-minimal-app => (board name) => (build profile)
```

-   **by calling explicitly building script:**

```
${MATTER_ROOT}/scripts/examples/mbed_example.sh -c=flash -a=all-clusters-minimal-app -b=<board name> -p=<build profile>
```

-   **by using VSCode launch task**:

```
Run and Debug (Ctrl+Shift+D) => Flash Mbed examples => Start Debugging (F5)  => (board name) => all-clusters-minimal-app => (build profile)
```

The last option uses the Open On-Chip Debugger to open and manage the gdb-server
session. Then gdb-client (arm-none-eabi-gdb) upload binary image and reset
device.

It is possible to connect to an external gdb-server session by using a specific
**'Flash Mbed examples [remote]'** task.

## Debugging

Debugging can be performed in the same was as with any other Matter example
ported to mbed-os platform.

The [Open On-Chip Debugger](http://openocd.org/) is used to to open and manage
the gdb-server session. Then gdb-client (arm-none-eabi-gdb) connect the server
to upload binary image and control debugging.

```
Run and Debug (Ctrl+Shift+D) => Debug Mbed examples => Start Debugging (F5) => (board name) => all-clusters-minimal-app => (build profile)
```

It is possible to connect to an external gdb-server session by using specific
**'Debug Mbed examples [remote]'** task.

## Testing

### Serial port terminal

The application traces are streaming to serial output. To start communication
open a terminal session and connect to the serial port of the device. You can
use **mbed-tools** for this purpose
([mbed-tools](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-tools)):

    ```
    mbed-tools sterm -p /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200 -e off
    ```

After device reset these lines should be visible:

    ```
    [INFO][CHIP]: [-]Mbed all-clusters-minimal-app example application start
    ...
    [INFO][CHIP]: [-]Mbed all-clusters-minimal-app example application run
    ```

The all-clusters-minimal-app application launched correctly and you can follow
traces in the terminal.

### CHIP Tools

Read the [MbedCommissioning](../../../docs/guides/mbedos_commissioning.md) to
see how to use different CHIP tools to commission and control the application
within a WiFi network.

# Device UI

This section lists the User Interface elements that you can use to control and
monitor the state of the device. These correspond to PCB components on the
platform image.

**USER LED** shows the overall state of the device and its connectivity. The
following states are possible:

-   _Short Flash On (50 ms on/950 ms off)_ &mdash; The device is in the
    unprovisioned (unpaired) state and is waiting for a commissioning
    application to connect.

-   _Rapid Even Flashing (100 ms on/100 ms off)_ &mdash; The device is in the
    unprovisioned state and a commissioning application is connected through
    Bluetooth LE.

-   _Short Flash Off (950ms on/50ms off)_ &mdash; The device is fully
    provisioned, but does not yet have full network or service connectivity.

-   _Solid On_ &mdash; The device is fully provisioned and has full network and
    service connectivity.

### Notes

Some of the supported boards may not have sufficient number PCB components to
follow above description. In that case please refer to
[Supported devices](#Supported-devices) section and check board's 'Platform
components' column for additional information about the limitation.
