/**
 * @brief Init BLE application manager
 *
 * In this example, the application manager is used to customize BLE advertising
 * parameters. This example is provided for platforms with Zephyr BLE manager support.
 *
 * @note This example set custom Zephyr BLE manager Matter advertising parameters (
 *  CONFIG_CHIP_CUSTOM_BLE_ADV_DATA for kconfig or ble_adv_data_custom for GN is set).
 *  To keep the advertising support for commissining, it is needed to register the whole
 *  adv data (adv flags + Matter adv data + custom adv data) and register scan
 *  response data as default adv and response data will be skipped.
 *  kAdvertisingFlags and manuf_data are given for examples, size of advertisingData and
 *  scanResponseData have to be set according to custom requirements.
 *
 * For custom Gatt services, APIs bt_gatt_service_register and bt_gatt_service_unregister
 * could be called at application layer. It will not override Matter Gatt services but
 * add new one.
 *
 * @note At the end of the commissioning advertising will be stopped.
 *
 * To start new advertising process, APIs :
 * chip::DeviceLayer::BLEAdvertisingArbiter::InsertRequest
 * chip::DeviceLayer::BLEAdvertisingArbiter::CancelRequest
 * could be called. If InsertRequest API is called several time, only the request with the
 * higher priority will be advertise.
