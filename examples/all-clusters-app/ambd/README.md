## Supported Device

The CHIP demo application is supported on [Ameba-D](https://www.amebaiot.com/en/amebad).


## Building the Example Application

Building the example application requires [Ameba-D SDK](https://github.com/pankore/ambd_sdk_with_chip_non_NDA).
Make sure the Ameba-D SDK and CHIP SDK are saved under the same directory.

-   To download Ameba-D SDK

          $ mkdir ${path-to-connectedhomeip}/../amebad_sdk
          $ cd ${path-to-connectedhomeip}/../amebad_sdk
          $ git clone https://github.com/pankore/ambd_sdk_with_chip_non_NDA.git

-   To setup building environment

          $ cd ${path-to-connectedhomeip}
          $ source ./scripts/bootstrap.sh
          $ source ./scripts/activate.sh

-   To build the demo application

          $ cd ${path-to-connectedhomeip}/examples/all-clusters-app/ambd
          $ ./build.sh
    
       The output image files are stored in `project_lp/asdk/image` and `project_hp/asdk/image` folders under Ameba-D SDK.
          
-   After building the application, **Ameba-D Image Tool** is used to flash it to Ameba-D board.
  1.  Connect your device via USB and open Ameba-D Image Tool.
  2.  Select correct serial port and set baudrate as **115200**.
  3.  Browse and add the corresponding image files in the Flash Download list to the correct locations
  4.  Click **Download** button.


## Commissioning and Cluster Control

### Commissioning
The commissioning is carried out via WiFi.

  1.  After download all-cluster example to Ameba-D board, boot up the board by pressing the reset button.
  2.  Use ATW commands to setup network.
  3.  Use ATS$ command to run all-cluster example.
  4.  Use
    [standalone chip-tool](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples/chip-tool)
    to communicate with the device.
    
          $ ./chip-tool pairing bypass 192.168.xx.xxx 11097

### Cluster Control

-   After successful commissioning, use the OnOff cluster command to control the
    OnOff attribute. This allows you to toggle a parameter implemented by the
    device to be On or Off.

          $ ./chip-tool onoff on 1
          $ ./chip-tool onoff off 1
