# CHIP Shell Reference

The `chip-shell` firmware exposes configuration and management APIs via a
command line interface (CLI). Use the shell CLI to experiment with CHIP
interactively, which can also be used with additional application code. The CHIP
functional test scripts use the shell CLI to execute test cases.

## Separator and escaping characters

The whitespace character (`' '`) is used to delimit the command name and the
different arguments, together with tab (`'\t'`) and new line characters (`'\r'`,
`'\n'`).

Some arguments might require to accept whitespaces on them. For those cases the
backslash character (`'\'`) can be used to escape separators or the backslash
itself.

Example:

```bash
> networkname Test\ Network
Done
> networkname
Test Network
Done
>
```
