## Building the Example Application

Building the example application requires the use of the Espressif ESP32 IoT
Development Framework and the xtensa-esp32-elf toolchain.

The VSCode devcontainer has these components pre-installed, so you can skip this
step. To install these components manually, follow these steps:

-   Clone the Espressif ESP-IDF and checkout
    [v4.3 tag](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases/v4.3)

          $ mkdir ${HOME}/tools
          $ cd ${HOME}/tools
          $ git clone https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
          $ cd esp-idf
          $ git checkout v4.3
          $ git submodule update --init
          $ ./install.sh

-   Install ninja-build

          $ sudo apt-get install ninja-build

Currently building in VSCode _and_ deploying from native is not supported, so
make sure the IDF_PATH has been exported(See the manual setup steps above).

-   Setting up the environment

        $ cd ${HOME}/tools/esp-idf
        $ ./install.sh
        $ . ./export.sh
        $ cd {path-to-connectedhomeip}

    To download and install packages.

        $ source ./scripts/bootstrap.sh
        $ source ./scripts/activate.sh

    If packages are already installed then simply activate them.

        $ source ./scripts/activate.sh

-   Configuration Options

    This application uses `ESP32-DevKitC` as a default device type. To use other
    ESP32 based device types, please refer
    [examples/all-clusters-app/esp32](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples/all-clusters-app/esp32)

-   To build the demo application.

          $ idf.py build

-   After building the application, to flash it outside of VSCode, connect your
    device via USB. Then run the following command to flash the demo application
    onto the device and then monitor its output. If necessary, replace
    `/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART`(MacOS) with the correct USB device name for your
    system(like `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux). Note that sometimes you might have to
    press and hold the `boot` button on the device while it's trying to connect
    before flashing. For ESP32-DevKitC devices this is labeled in the
    [functional description diagram](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-devkitc.html#functional-description).

          $ idf.py -p /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART flash monitor

    Note: Some users might have to install the
    [VCP driver](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
    before the device shows up on `/dev/tty`.

-   Quit the monitor by hitting `Ctrl+]`.

    Note: You can see a menu of various monitor commands by hitting
    `Ctrl+t Ctrl+h` while the monitor is running.

-   If desired, the monitor can be run again like so:

          $ idf.py -p /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART monitor

## Commissioning and cluster control

Commissioning can be carried out using WiFi, BLE or Bypass.

1.  Set the `Rendezvous Mode` for commissioning using menuconfig; the default
    Rendezvous mode is BLE.

         $ idf.py menuconfig

Select the Rendezvous Mode via `Demo -> Rendezvous Mode`. If Rendezvous Mode is
Bypass then set the credentials of the WiFi Network (i.e. SSID and Password from
menuconfig).

`idf.py menuconfig -> Component config -> CHIP Device Layer -> WiFi Station Options`

2.  Now flash the device with the same command as before. (Use the right `/dev`
    device)

          $ idf.py -p /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART flash monitor

3.  The device should boot up. When device connects to your network, you will
    see a log like this on the device console.

          I (5524) chip[DL]: SYSTEM_EVENT_STA_GOT_IP
          I (5524) chip[DL]: IPv4 address changed on WiFi station interface: <IP_ADDRESS>...

4.  Use
    [python based device controller](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/src/controller/python)
    or
    [standalone chip-tool](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples/chip-tool)
    or
    [iOS chip-tool app](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/src/darwin/CHIPTool)
    or
    [Android chip-tool app](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/src/android/CHIPTool)
    to communicate with the device.

Note: The ESP32 does not support 5GHz networks. Also, the Device will persist
your network configuration. To erase it, simply run.

    $ idf.py -p /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART erase_flash

### Setting up Python Controller

Once ESP32 is up and running, we need to set up a device controller to perform
commissioning and cluster control.

-   Set up python controller.

           $ cd {path-to-connectedhomeip}
           $ ./scripts/build_python.sh -m platform

-   Execute the controller.

           $ source ./out/python_env/bin/activate
           $ chip-device-ctrl

### Commissioning over BLE

-   Establish the secure session over BLE. BLE is the default mode in the
    application and is configurable through menuconfig.

         - chip-device-ctrl > ble-scan
         - chip-device-ctrl > connect -ble 3840 20202021 135246

         Parameters:
         1. Discriminator: 3840 (configurable through menuconfig)
         2. Setup-pin-code: 20202021 (configurable through menuconfig)
         3. Node ID: Optional.
            If not passed in this command, then it is auto-generated by the controller and displayed in the output of connect.
            The same value should be used in the next commands.
            We have chosen a random node ID which is 135246.

-   Add credentials of the Wi-Fi network you want the ESP32 to connect to, using
    the `AddWiFiNetwork` command and then enable the ESP32 to connect to it
    using `EnableWiFiNetwork` command. In this example, we have used `TESTSSID`
    and `TESTPASSWD` as the SSID and passphrase respectively.

         - chip-device-ctrl > zcl NetworkCommissioning AddWiFiNetwork 135246 0 0 ssid=str:TESTSSID credentials=str:TESTPASSWD breadcrumb=0 timeoutMs=1000

         - chip-device-ctrl > zcl NetworkCommissioning EnableNetwork 135246 0 0 networkID=str:TESTSSID breadcrumb=0 timeoutMs=1000

-   Close the BLE connection to ESP32, as it is not required hereafter.

         - chip-device-ctrl > close-ble

-   Resolve DNS-SD name and update address of the node in the device controller.

         - chip-device-ctrl > resolve 0 135246

### Cluster control

-   The demo application supports TemperatureMeasurement and Basic cluster.

    `chip-device-ctrl > zcl Basic MfgSpecificPing 135246 1 0`

### Flashing app using script

-   Follow these steps to use `${app_name}.flash.py`.

    -   First set IDF target, run set-target with one of the commands.

            $ idf.py set-target esp32
            $ idf.py set-target esp32c3

    -   Execute below sequence of commands

```
        $ export ESPPORT=/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART
        $ export ESPBAUD=${baud_value}
        $ idf.py build
        $ idf.py flashing_script
        $ python ${app_name}.flash.py
```

## Optimization

Optimization related to WiFi, BLuetooth, Asserts etc are the part of this
example by default. To enable this option set is_debug=false from command-line.

```
idf.py -p /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART -Dis_debug=false build flash monitor
```
