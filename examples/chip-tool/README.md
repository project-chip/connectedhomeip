## Building the Example Application

Building the example application is quite straightforward.

-   In the root of the example directory, run `make`.

          $ make

-   After the application is built, it can be found in the build directory as
    `chip-standalone-demo.out`

## Using the Echo Client

To start the Echo Client run the built executable.

          $ ./build/chip-standalone-demo.out

The app will prompt the user for the server's IP address and Port. If valid
values are supplied, it will begin to priodically sending messages to the server
address provided.

It also verifies that the incoming echo from the server matches what was sent
out.

Stop the Client at anytime with `Ctrl + C`.
