# CHIP ESP32 Pigweed Example Application

The ESP32 example demonstrates the usage of Pigweed module functionalities in an
application.

The example is based on [CHIP](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip),
the [Pigweed](https://pigweed.googlesource.com/pigweed/pigweed) module, which is
a collection of libraries that provide different functionalities for embedded
systems, and the ESP32 platform.

You can use this example as a training ground for making experiments, testing
Pigweed module features and checking what actions are necessary to fully
integrate Pigweed in a CHIP project.

Pigweed functionalities are being gradually integrated into CHIP. Currently, the
following features are available:

-   **Echo RPC** - Creates a Remote Procedure Call server and allows sending
    commands through the serial port to the device, which makes echo and sends
    the received commands back.

## Building the Example Application

Building the example application requires the use of the Espressif ESP32 IoT
Development Framework and the xtensa-esp32-elf toolchain.

The VSCode devcontainer has these components pre-installed, so you can skip this
step. To install these components manually, follow these steps:

-   Clone the Espressif ESP-IDF and checkout release/v4.1 branch

          $ mkdir ${HOME}/tools
          $ cd ${HOME}/tools
          $ git clone https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
          $ cd esp-idf
          $ git checkout release/v4.1
          $ git submodule update --init
          $ export IDF_PATH=${HOME}/tools/esp-idf
          $ ./install.sh

-   Install ninja-build

          $ sudo apt-get install ninja-build

### To build the application, follow these steps:

Currently building in VSCode _and_ deploying from native is not supported, so
make sure the IDF_PATH has been exported(See the manual setup steps above).

-   In the root of the example directory, sync the CHIP tree's submodules and
    source `idf.sh`. Note: This does not have to be repeated for incremental
    builds.

          $ source idf.sh

-   Configuration Options

        To choose from the different configuration options, run menuconfig

          $ idf make menuconfig

        This example uses UART0 for serial communication. You can change this through
        `PW RPC Example Configuration`. As a result, the console has been shifted to UART1
        You can change this through `Component config` -> `Common ESP-related` ->
        `UART for console output`

        To use the default configuration options, run the default config

          $ idf make defconfig

-   Run make to build the demo application.

          $ idf make

-   After building the application, to flash it outside of VSCode, connect your
    device via USB. Then run the following command to flash the demo application
    onto the device and then monitor its output. If necessary, replace
    `/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART`(MacOS) with the correct USB device name for your
    system(like `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux). Note that sometimes you might have to
    press and hold the `boot` button on the device while it's trying to connect
    before flashing. For ESP32-DevKitC devices this is labeled in the
    [functional description diagram](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-devkitc.html#functional-description).

          $ idf make flash ESPPORT=/dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART

    Note: Some users might have to install the
    [VCP driver](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
    before the device shows up on `/dev/tty`.

## Testing the Example Application

Run the following command to start an interactive Python shell, where the Echo
RPC commands can be invoked:

        python -m pw_hdlc.rpc_console --device /dev/tty.SLAB_USBtoUART -b 115200 $CHIP_ROOT/third_party/pigweed/repo/pw_rpc/pw_rpc_protos/echo.proto -o /tmp/pw_rpc.out

To send an Echo RPC message, type the following command, where the actual
message is the text in quotation marks after the `msg=` phrase:

        rpcs.pw.rpc.EchoService.Echo(msg="hi")
