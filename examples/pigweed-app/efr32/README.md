# CHIP EFR32 Pigweed Example Application

The EFR32 example demonstrates the usage of Pigweed module functionalities in an
application.

The example is based on [CHIP](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip),
the [Pigweed](https://pigweed.googlesource.com/pigweed/pigweed) module, which is
a collection of libraries that provide different functionalities for embedded
systems, and the EFR32 platform.

You can use this example as a training ground for making experiments, testing
Pigweed module features and checking what actions are necessary to fully
integrate Pigweed in a CHIP project.

Pigweed functionalities are being gradually integrated into CHIP. Currently, the
following features are available:

-   **Echo RPC** - Creates a Remote Procedure Call server and allows sending
    commands through the serial port to the device, which makes echo and sends
    the received commands back.

## Building the Example Application

-   Download or clone the
    [sdk_support](https://github.com/SiliconLabs/sdk_support) from GitHub
    $ git clone https://github.com/SiliconLabs/sdk_support.git
    and export the path with :
            $
    export EFR32_SDK_ROOT=<Path to cloned git repo>

-   Download the
    [Simplicity Commander](https://www.silabs.com/mcu/programming-options)
    command line tool, and ensure that `commander` is your shell search path.
    (For Mac OS X, `commander` is located inside
    `Commander.app/Contents/MacOS/`.)

            export PATH=/Applications/Commander.app/Contents/MacOS:$PATH

-   Download and install a suitable ARM gcc tool chain:
    [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain 9-2019-q4-major](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)

-   Install some additional tools(likely already present for CHIP developers):

           # Linux
           sudo apt-get install git libwebkitgtk-1.0-0 ninja-build

           # Mac OS X
           brew install ninja

-   Supported hardware:

    MG12 boards:

    -   BRD4161A / SLWSTK6000B / Wireless Starter Kit / 2.4GHz@19dBm
    -   BRD4163A / SLWSTK6000B / Dual band Wireless Starter Kit / 2.4GHz@19dBm,
        868MHz@19dBm
    -   BRD4164A / SLWSTK6000B / Dual band Wireless Starter Kit / 2.4GHz@19dBm,
        915MHz@19dBm
    -   BRD4166A / SLTB004A / Thunderboard Sense 2 / 2.4GHz@10dBm
    -   BRD4170A / SLWSTK6000B / Multiband Wireless Starter Kit / 2.4GHz@19dBm,
        915MHz@19dBm
    -   BRD4304A / SLWSTK6000B / MGM12P Module / 2.4GHz@19dBm

    MG21 boards:

    -   BRD4180A / SLWSTK6006A / Wireless Starter Kit / 2.4GHz@20dBm

*   Build the example application:

        cd ~/connectedhomeip/examples/pigweed-app/efr32
        git submodule update --init
        source third_party/connectedhomeip/scripts/activate.sh
        export EFR32_SDK_ROOT=<path-to-silabs-sdk-v2.7>
        export EFR32_BOARD=BRD4161A
        gn gen out/debug --args="efr32_sdk_root=\"${EFR32_SDK_ROOT}\" efr32_board=\"${EFR32_BOARD}\""
        ninja -C out/debug

-   To delete generated executable, libraries and object files use:

          cd ~/connectedhomeip/examples/pigweed-app/efr32
          rm -rf out/

### Flashing the Application

-   On the command line:

        cd ~/connectedhomeip/examples/pigweed-app/efr32
        python3 out/debug/chip-efr32-pigweed-example.flash.py

-   With the Commander app, just load the .s37 file.
-   Or with the Ozone debugger, just load the .out file.

## Testing the Example Application

Determine the serial port name for the EFR device by checking /dev: ls
/dev/tty\*

    It should look like this :
    - On Linux
        /dev/ttyACM0
    - On MAC
        /dev/tty.usbmodem0004401548451

Run the following command to start an interactive Python shell, where the Echo
RPC commands can be invoked:

        python -m pw_hdlc.rpc_console --device /dev/tty.usbmodem0004401548451 -b 115200 $CHIP_ROOT/third_party/pigweed/repo/pw_rpc/pw_rpc_protos/echo.proto -o /tmp/pw_rpc.out

To send an Echo RPC message, type the following command, where the actual
message is the text in quotation marks after the `msg=` phrase:

        rpcs.pw.rpc.EchoService.Echo(msg="hi")

    Note: Some users might have to install the
    [VCP driver](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
    before the device shows up on `/dev/tty`.
