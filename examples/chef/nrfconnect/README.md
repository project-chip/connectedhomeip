# CHIP nRF Connect SDK Shell Application

A [chip-shell](../README.md) project for the Nordic nRF52840 and nRF5340
development kits, built using the nRF Connect SDK.

## Building

The steps to build the Shell Application for Nordic Semiconductor's development
kits are exactly the same as in case of the Lock Example. Please refer to
[this guide](../../lock-app/nrfconnect/README.md) to learn how to build,
program, and debug the application.
