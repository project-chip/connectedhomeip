# MATTER CHEF APP

The purpose of the chef app is to to increase the coverage of device types in
Matter.

It uses the shell app a starting point, adding the processing of ZAP files and
the support of a few targets under a unified build script: `chef.py`.

As it incorporates the processing of ZAP files as part of the build process, it
does not use `zzz_generated`, but rather places the auto-generated zap artifacts
under its `zap-generated` temporary folder.

All device types available (DM/IM .zap files) are found inside the `devices`
folder.

## Building a Sample Application

Run `chef.py -h` to see the available commands

## Building your first sample

1. Make sure you have the toolchain installed for your desired target
2. Run `chef.py` the first time to create a `config.yaml` configuration file. If
   you already have SDK environment variables such as IDF_PATH (esp32) and
   ZEPHYR_BASE (nrfconnect) it will use those values as default.
3. Update your the SDK paths on `config.yaml`. TTY is the path used by the
   platform to enumerate its device as a serial port. Typical values are:

```
    # ESP32 macOS

    TTY: /dev/tty.usbmodemXXXXXXX

    # ESP32 Linux

    TTY: /dev/ttyACM0

    # NRFCONNECT macOS

    TTY: /dev/tty.usbserial-XXXXX

    # NRFCONNECT Linux

    TTY: /dev/ttyUSB0
```

4. Run `$ chef.py -u` to update zap and the toolchain (on selected platforms)
5. Run `$ chef.py -gzbf -t <platform> -d lighting`. This command will run the
   ZAP GUI opening the `devices/lighting.zap` file and will allow editing. It
   will then generate the zap artifacts, place them on the `zap-generated`
   folder, run a build and flash the binary in your target

## Creating a new device type in your device library

1. Run `$ chef.py -g -d <device>` to open in the ZAP GUI a device to be used as
   a starting point.
2. Edit your cluster configurations
3. Click on `Save As` and save the file with the name of your new device type
   into the `devices` folder. This device is now available for the script. See
   `chef.py -h` for a list of devices available.

## CI

All CI jobs for chef can be found in `.github/workflows/chef.yaml`.

These jobs use a platform-specific image with base `chip-build`.

CI jobs call chef with the options `--ci -t <PLATFORM>`. The `--ci` option will
execute builds for all devices specified in `cicd_config["ci_allow_list"]`
defined in `chef.py` (so long as these devices are also in `/devices`) on the
specified platform.
