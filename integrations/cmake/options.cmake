#    Description:
#      This file is the CMake template for defining global build options for the CHIP SDK.
#

#
# This option chooses whether to optimize builds of third_party packages:
#
#   ON: If available, use optimized cmake scripts specified by the CHIP project.
#       This option will result in faster builds, but require updates when upstream
#       diverges. The optimization is applied for libs that don't change often and
#       can provide a measurable benefit from recasting the build using cmake.
#
#   OFF: Use the native build system provided the third_party project (autotools or other).
#
option(BUILD_EXTERNALS_WITH_CMAKE
    "Builds third_party packages with optimized cmake. Otherwise, use the native build system provided by the package."
    ON
)

if (NOT BUILD_EXTERNALS_WITH_CMAKE)
include(ExternalProject)

# Provides selection of the cryptographic implementation.
#
set(with_crypto "mbedtls" CACHE STRING "Specify the crypto implementation from one of: auto, mbedtls, or openssl (default=auto)")
set_property(CACHE with_crypto PROPERTY STRINGS mbedtls openssl)

#
# Provides selection of the network layer technology.
#
set(with_network "all" CACHE STRING "Specify the target network layers from one of: ble, inet, or all (default=all)")
set_property(CACHE with_network PROPERTY STRINGS all inet ble)

#
# Provides selection of the system layer technology.
#
set(with_system "sockets" CACHE STRING "Specify the target network stack from one of: sockets, lwip or Network.framework (default=sockets)")
set_property(CACHE with_system PROPERTY STRINGS sockets lwip Network.framework)

# Map CMake target descriptions to same names as autotools and gn for convenience.
