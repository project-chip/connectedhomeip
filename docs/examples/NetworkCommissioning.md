# Network Commissioning Cluster

All example applications are configured with two Network Commissioning Cluster instance (0 and 65534). This is because the common config will be used by many of platforms with different set of interfaces. However, in production, the case will be much simplier -- the project is targeted at only one (or small set of) platforms.

For building real productions, you should change the config of network commissioning cluster to reflect the real setup of your application.
