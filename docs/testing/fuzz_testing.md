# Fuzz testing

-   Fuzz Testing involves providing random and unexpected data as input to
    functions and methods to uncover bugs, security vulnerabilities, or to
    determine if the software crashes.
-   it is often continuous; the function under test is called in iteration with
    thousands of different inputs.
-   Fuzz testing is often done with sanitizers enabled; to catch memory errors
    and undefined behavior.
-   The most commonly used fuzz testing frameworks for C/C++ are LibFuzzer and
    AFL.
-   [Google's FuzzTest](https://github.com/google/fuzztest) is a newer framework
    that simplifies writing fuzz tests with user-friendly APIs and offers more
    control over input generation. It also integrates seamlessly with Google
    Test (GTest).

## `Google's FuzzTest`

-   Google FuzzTest is integrated through Pigweed
    [pw_fuzzer](https://pigweed.dev/pw_fuzzer/concepts.html).

### Use cases

1. Finding Undefined Behavior with Sanitizers:

    - Running fuzz tests while checking if a crash or other sanitizer-detected
      error occurs, allowing detection of subtle memory issues like buffer
      overflows and use-after-free errors.

2. Find Correctness Bugs using Assertions:
    - For example, in Round trip Fuzzing, fuzzed input is encoded, decoded, and
      then verified to match the original input. An example of this can be found
      in src/setup_payload/tests/FuzzBase38PW.cpp.

-   More information can be found in the
    [FuzzTest Use Cases](https://github.com/google/fuzztest/blob/main/doc/use-cases.md)
    documentation.

### Writing FuzzTests

Keywords: Property Function, Input Domain

-   FuzzTests are instantiated through the macro call of `FUZZ_TEST`:

```cpp
FUZZ_TEST(TLVReader, FuzzTlvReader).WithDomains(fuzztest::Arbitrary<std::vector<std::uint8_t>>());
```

-   The Macro invocation calls the **Property Function**, which is
    `FuzzTlvReader` above.

-   The **input domains** define the range and type of inputs that the
    **property function** will receive during fuzzing, specified using the
    `.WithDomains()` clause.
-   In the macro above, FuzzTest will generate a wide range of possible byte
    vectors to thoroughly test the `FuzzTlvReader` function.

#### The Property Function

```cpp
// The Property Function
void FuzzTlvRead(const std::vector<std::uint8_t> & bytes)
{
    TLVReader reader;
    reader.Init(bytes.data(), bytes.size());
    chip::TLV::Utilities::Iterate(reader, FuzzIterator, nullptr);
}
```

-   The Property Functions must return a `void`
-   The function will be run with many different inputs in the same process,
    trying to trigger a crash.
-   It is possible to include Assertions such as during Round-Trip Fuzzing

-   More Information:
    https://github.com/google/fuzztest/blob/main/doc/fuzz-test-macro.md#the-property-function

#### Input Domains

-   FuzzTest Offers many Input Domains, all of which are part of the
    `fuzztest::` namespace.
-   All native C++ types can be used through `Arbitrary<T>()`:

```cpp
FUZZ_TEST(Base38Decoder, FuzzQRCodeSetupPayloadParser).WithDomains(Arbitrary<std::string>());
```

-   using vector domains is one of the most common. It is possible to limit the
    size of the input vectors (or any container domain) using `.WithMaxSize()`
    or `.WithMinSize()`, as shown below:

```cpp
FUZZ_TEST(MinimalmDNS, TxtResponderFuzz).WithDomains(Arbitrary<vector<uint8_t>>().WithMaxSize(254));
```

-   `ElementOf` is particularly useful as it allows us to define a domain by
    explicitly enumerating the set of values in it and passing it to FuzzTest
    invocation. Example:

```cpp
auto AnyProtocolID()
{
    return ElementOf({ chip::Protocols::SecureChannel::Id, chip::Protocols::InteractionModel::Id, chip::Protocols::BDX::Id,
                       chip::Protocols::UserDirectedCommissioning::Id });
}

FUZZ_TEST(PayloadDecoder, RunDecodeFuzz).WithDomains(Arbitrary<std::vector<std::uint8_t>>(), AnyProtocolID(), Arbitrary<uint8_t>());
```

-   A detailed reference for input domains can be found here:
    [FuzzTest Domain Reference](https://github.com/google/fuzztest/blob/main/doc/domains-reference.md#elementof-domains-element-of).

### Running FuzzTests

There are several ways to run the tests:

1.  Unit-test mode (where the inputs are only fuzzed for a second):

```bash
./fuzz-chip-cert-pw
```

2.  Continuous fuzzing mode; we need to first list the tests, then specify the
    FuzzTestCase to run:

```bash
$ ./fuzz-chip-cert-pw --list_fuzz_tests
[.] Sanitizer coverage enabled. Counter map size: 11134, Cmp map size: 262144
[*] Fuzz test: ChipCert.ChipCertFuzzer
[*] Fuzz test: ChipCert.DecodeChipCertFuzzer

$ ./fuzz-chip-cert-pw --fuzz=ChipCert.DecodeChipCertFuzzer
```

3. Running all Tests in a TestSuite for a specific time, e.g for 10 minutes

```bash
#both Fuzz Tests will be run for 10 minutes each
./fuzz-chip-cert-pw --fuzz_for=10m
```

4. For Help

```bash
# FuzzTest related help
./fuzz-chip-cert-pw --helpfull

# gtest related help
./fuzz-chip-cert-pw --help
