## Third Party Tools

Some tools and utilities are dependent on third party tools, such as Docker.

[Docker](https://www.docker.com) is an excellent way to have stable build
environments that don't pollute the host OS. It is also much easier to maintain
stability across multiple host environments. Install stable version of
[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) relevant to
your native OS (macOS or Windows). Once installed, you can run docker commands
from the shell/terminal.
