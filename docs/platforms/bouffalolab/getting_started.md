    -   `-easyflash`, specifies to use `easyflash` for flash access.

        > `littlefs` has different format with `easyflash`, please uses
        > `-easyflash` for your in-field production

-   `-rotating_device_id`, enable rotating device id

-   `-mfd`, enable Matter factory data feature, which load factory data from
    `MFD` partition

    -   Please refer to
        [Bouffalo Lab Matter factory data guide](./matter_factory_data.md) or
        contact to `Bouffalo Lab` for support.

-   `-shell`, enable command line

-   `-rpc`, enable Pigweed RPC feature, which will use `baudrate` 115200 for PRC

-   `-cdc`, enable USB CDC feature, only support for BL706, and can't work with
    Ethernet Board

> `Bouffalo Lab` Matter project uses UART `baudrate` 2000000 for logging output
> by default. If you want other `baudrate` for your test station, please change
> variable `baudrate` in `BUILD.gn` under example project.

## Build an example

Taking lighting app with `littlefs` supported as example :

-   BL602DK with Wi-Fi

    ```
    ./scripts/build/build_examples.py --target bouffalolab-bl602dk-light-wifi-littlefs build
    ```

-   BL616DK with Wi-Fi

    ```shell
    ./scripts/build/build_examples.py --target bouffalolab-bl616dk-light-wifi-littlefs build
    ```

-   BL616 with Thread

    ```
    ./scripts/build/build_examples.py --target bouffalolab-bl616dk-light-thread-littlefs build
    ```

-   BL704L with Thread

    ```
    ./scripts/build/build_examples.py --target bouffalolab-bl704ldk-light-thread-littlefs build
    ```

-   BL706 with Thread

    ```
    ./scripts/build/build_examples.py --target bouffalolab-bl706dk-light-thread-littlefs build
    ```

-   BL706 with Ethernet

    ```
    ./scripts/build/build_examples.py --target bouffalolab-bl706dk-light-ethernet-littlefs build
    ```

-   BL706 with Wi-Fi

    ```
    ./scripts/build/build_examples.py --target bouffalolab-bl706dk-light-ethernet-littlefs build
    ```

    > This BL706 + BL602 Wi-Fi solution: BL602 runs WLAN part and BL706 runs
    > TCP/IP stack which uses SPI for communication between these two parts.

# Download image

Take build target `bouffalolab-bl602dk-light-wifi-littlefs` as example to
introduce image downloading steps.

After example compiled, a python script `chip-bl602-lighting-example.flash.py`
will be generated out under `./out/bouffalolab-bl602dk-light-wifi-littlefs/` and
is used to download image to `Bouffalo Lab` SoC.

And download image as following steps:

-   Connect the board to your build machine with USB cable

-   Put the SoC to the download mode:

    -   Press and hold the **BOOT** button.
    -   Click the **RESET** or **EN** button.
    -   Release the **BOOT** button.

-   Type following command for image download. Please set serial port
    accordingly, here we use /dev/ttyACM0 as a serial port example.

    ```shell
    ./out/bouffalolab-bl602dk-light-wifi-littlefs/chip-bl602-lighting-example.flash.py --port /dev/ttyACM0
    ```

    If needs to download image with the whole flash erased, please append
    `--erase` option.

    ```shell
    ./out/bouffalolab-bl602dk-light-wifi-littlefs/chip-bl602-lighting-example.flash.py --port /dev/ttyACM0 --erase
    ```

    > Note, better to append --erase option to download image for BL602 develop
    > board at first time.

-   Then, open serial console `/dev/ttyACM0` with `baudrate` 2000000. The log
    will output if the **RESET** or **EN** button clicked.

# Test Commission and Control with chip-tool

Please follow
[chip_tool_guide](../../development_controllers/chip-tool/chip_tool_guide.md) to
build and [guide](../../../examples/chip-tool/README.md) use chip-tool for test.

## Prerequisite for Thread Protocol

Thread wireless protocol could runs on BL704L/BL706/BL616, which needs a Thread
border router to connect Thread network to Wi-Fi/Ethernet network. Please follow
this [guide](../openthread/openthread_border_router_pi.md) to setup a raspberry
Pi border router.

After Thread border router setup, please type following command on Thread border
router to get Thread network credential.

```shell
sudo ot-ctl dataset active -x
```

## Commissioning over BLE

-   Reset the board or factory reset the board

-   Enter build out folder of chip-tool and running the following command to do
    BLE commission

    -   Wi-Fi

        ```shell
        ./out/linux-x64-chip-tool/chip-tool pairing ble-wifi <device_node_id> <wifi_ssid> <wifi_passwd> 20202021 3840
        ```

    -   Thread

        ```shell
        ./out/linux-x64-chip-tool/chip-tool pairing ble-thread <device_node_id> hex:<thread_operational_dataset> 20202021 3840
        ```

    -   Ethernet
        `./out/linux-x64-chip-tool/chip-tool pairing onnetwork <device_node_id> 20202021`
        > `<device_node_id>`, which is node ID assigned to device with
        > chip-tool;<br>`<wifi_ssid>`, Wi-Fi network SSID;<br>`<wifi_passwd>`,
        > Wi-FI network password;<br>`<thread_operational_dataset>`, Thread
        > network credential which running `sudo ot-ctl dataset active -x`
        > command on border router to get.

## Read a cluster attribute

```
./out/linux-x64-chip-tool/chip-tool basicinformation read vendor-name <device_node_id> 0
```
