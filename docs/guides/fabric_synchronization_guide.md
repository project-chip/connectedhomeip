## Fabric Sync Example Applications

Fabric-Admin and Fabric-Bridge example applications are provided to demonstrate
Fabric Synchronization feature. You can find them in the examples.

![matter_fabric_synchronization](images/matter_fabric_synchronization.png)

Fabric-Admin example app implements the Fabric Administrator role and
communicates with the Fabric-Bridge-App on the other side, facilitating the
Fabric Synchronization process.

Fabric-Bridge-App example app implements the Aggregator device type with Fabric
Synchronization condition met and demonstrates the end-to-end Fabric
Synchronization feature using dynamic endpoints.

Fabric Synchronization can be triggered from either side. The initiator of the
Fabric Synchronization process, who shares their devices, takes on the
Commissioner role. The recipient of the Fabric Synchronization request, who
receives the shared devices, assumes the Commissionee role. This flexibility
enables a seamless and efficient synchronization process.

## Run Fabric Sync Demo on RP4

### Setup Fabric Source

Connect to the Fabric Source server:

```
ssh ubuntu@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

Password: <password>

Run the Fabric Source script:

```
./run_fabric_source.sh
```

### Setup Fabric Sink

Connect to the Fabric Sink server:

```
ssh ubuntu@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
```

Password: <password>

Run the Fabric Sink script:

```
./run_fabric_sink.sh
```

### Fabric Sync Setup

Enable Fabric Auto Sync:

In Fabric-Sync console:

```
fabricsync enable-auto-sync 1
```

Pair the Fabric-Source bridge to Fabric-Sync with node ID 1:

```
fabricsync add-bridge 1 <fabric-sink-ip>
```

### Pair Light Example to Fabric-Source

Pair the Light Example with node ID 3 using its payload number:

```
pairing already-discovered 3 20202021 <ip> 5540
```

After the Light Example is successfully paired in Fabric-Source, it will be
synced to Fabric-Sink with a new assigned node ID.

Toggle the Light Example:

From Fabric-Source:

```
onoff on <node-id> 1
onoff off <node-id> 1
```

From Fabric-Sink: (Use the node ID assigned)

```
onoff on x 1
onoff off x 1
```

### Remove Light Example from Fabric-Source

Unpair the Light Example:

```
pairing unpair <node-id>
```

After the Light Example is successfully unpaired from Fabric-Source, it will
also be removed from the Fabric-Sink.

### Pair Commercial Switch to Fabric-Source

Pair the switch using its payload number:

In Fabric-Source console:

```
pairing code-wifi <node-id> <ssid> <passwd> <payload>
```

After the switch is successfully paired in Fabric-Source, it will be synced to
Fabric-Sink with a new assigned node ID.

Toggle the switch:

From Fabric-Source:

```
onoff on <node-id> 1
onoff off <node-id> 1
```

From Fabric-Sink: (Use the node ID assigned)

```
onoff on <node-id> 1
onoff off <node-id> 1
```

### Remove Switch from Fabric-Source

Unpair the switch:

```
pairing unpair <node-id>
```

After the switch is successfully unpaired from Fabric-Source, it will also be
removed from the Fabric-Sink.
