# Performing Device Firmware Upgrade in the nRF Connect SDK examples

The following examples for the development kits from Nordic Semiconductor
support over-the-air Device Firmware Upgrade:

-   [CHIP nRF Connect Lock Example Application](../../examples/lock-app/nrfconnect/README.md)
-   [CHIP nRF Connect Lighting Example Application](../../examples/lighting-app/nrfconnect/README.md)

Currently, the Bluetooth LE is the only available transport for performing the
DFU operation and it uses
[Simple Management Protocol](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/zephyr/guides/device_mgmt/index.html#device-mgmt).
The upgrade can be done either using a smartphone application or a PC command
line tool.

## Device Firmware Upgrade using smartphone

To upgrade your device firmware over Bluetooth LE using smartphone, complete the
following steps:

1. Install one of the following applications on your smartphone:

    - [nRF Connect for Mobile](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Connect-for-mobile)
    - [nRF Toolbox](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Tools/nRF-Toolbox)

2. Push **Button 1** on the device to enable the software update functionality.
3. Push **Button 4** on the device to start the Bluetooth LE advertising.
4. Follow the instructions about downloading the new image to a device on the
   [FOTA upgrades](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/ug_nrf52.html#fota-upgrades)
   page in the nRF Connect documentation.

## Device Firmware Upgrade using PC command line tool

To upgrade your device firmware over Bluetooth LE, you can use the PC command
line tool provided by the [mcumgr](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/mcumgr)
project.

> **_WARNING:_** mcumgr tool using Bluetooth LE is available only for Linux and
> macOS systems. On Windows, there is no support for Device Firmware Upgrade
> over Bluetooth LE yet.

Complete the following steps to perform DFU using mcumgr:

1. Install the tool by following the
   [mcumgr command line tool installation instructions](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/zephyr/guides/device_mgmt/index.html#command-line-tool).
2. Push **Button 1** on the device to enable software update functionality.
3. Push **Button 4** on the device to start the Bluetooth LE advertising.

> **_NOTE:_** In all of the commands listed in the following steps, replace
> `ble-hci-number` with the Bluetooth hci integer value (for example, `0`) and
> `ble-device-name` with the CHIP device name advertised over Bluetooth LE (for
> example, `MatterLock`).

4.  Upload the firmware image to the device by running the following command in
    your example directory:

        $ sudo mcumgr --conntype ble --hci ble-hci-number --connstring peer_name='ble-device-name' image upload build/zephyr/app_update.bin

    The operation can take few minutes. Wait until the progress bar reaches
    100%.

5.  Obtain the list of images present in the device memory by running following
    command:

        $ sudo mcumgr --conntype ble --hci ble-hci-number --connstring peer_name='ble-device-name' image list

    The displayed output contains the old image in slot 0 that is currently
    active and the new image in slot 1, which is not active yet (flags field
    empty):

        Images:
        image=0 slot=0
            version: 0.0.0
            bootable: true
            flags: active confirmed
            hash: 7bb0e909a846e833465cbb44c581cf045413a5446c6953a30a3dcc2c3ad51764
        image=0 slot=1
            version: 0.0.0
            bootable: true
            flags:
            hash: cbd58fc3821e749d3abfb00b3069f98c078824735f1b2a333e8a1579971e7de1
        Split status: N/A (0)

6.  Swap the firmware images by calling the following method with `image-hash`
    replaced by the image present in the slot 1 hash (for example,
    `cbd58fc3821e749d3abfb00b3069f98c078824735f1b2a333e8a1579971e7de1`):

        $ sudo mcumgr --conntype ble --hci ble-hci-number --connstring peer_name='ble-device-name' image test image-hash

    You can observe that the `flags:` field in the image for slot 1 changes
    value to `pending`:

        Images:
        image=0 slot=0
            version: 0.0.0
            bootable: true
            flags: active confirmed
            hash: 7bb0e909a846e833465cbb44c581cf045413a5446c6953a30a3dcc2c3ad51764
        image=0 slot=1
            version: 0.0.0
            bootable: true
            flags: pending
            hash: cbd58fc3821e749d3abfb00b3069f98c078824735f1b2a333e8a1579971e7de1
        Split status: N/A (0)

7.  Reset the device with the following command to let the bootloader swap
    images:

        $ sudo mcumgr --conntype ble --hci ble-hci-number --connstring peer_name='ble-device-name' reset

    The device is reset and the following notifications appear in its console:

        *** Booting Zephyr OS build zephyr-v2.5.0-1101-ga9d3aef65424  ***
        I: Starting bootloader
        I: Primary image: magic=good, swap_type=0x2, copy_done=0x1, image_ok=0x1
        I: Secondary image: magic=good, swap_type=0x2, copy_done=0x3, image_ok=0x3
        I: Boot source: none
        I: Swap type: test

    Swapping operation can take some time, and after it completes, the new
    firmware is booted.

Visit the
[mcumgr image management](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/zephyr/guides/device_mgmt/indexhtml#image-management)
section to get familiar with all image management commands supported by the
tool.
