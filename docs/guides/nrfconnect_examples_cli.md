# Using CLI in nRF Connect examples

Some Matter examples for the development kits from Nordic Semiconductor include
a command-line interface that allows access to application logs and
[Zephyr shell](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/1.13.0/subsystems/shell.html).

## Accessing the CLI console

To access the CLI console, use a serial terminal emulator of your choice, like
Minicom or GNU Screen. Use the baud rate set to `115200`.

For example, to start using the CLI console with Minicom, run the following
command with `/dev/ttyACM0` replaced with the device node name of your
development kit:

    ```
    minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0 -b 115200
    ```

When you reboot the kit, you will see the boot logs in the console, similar to
the following messages:

```shell
uart:~$
I: nRF5 802154 radio initialized
I: 8 Sectors of 4096 bytes
I: alloc wra: 0, ff0
I: data wra: 0, 0
*** Booting Zephyr OS build v2.4.0-ncs1  ***
I: Init CHIP stack
...
```

This means that the console is working correctly and you can start using shell
commands. For example, issuing the `kernel threads` command will print
information about all running threads:

```shell
uart:~$ kernel threads
Scheduler: 277 since last call
Threads:
 0x20006518 CHIP
        options: 0x0, priority: -1 timeout: 536896912
        state: pending
        stack size 8192, unused 7256, usage 936 / 8192 (11 %)

 0x20004ab0 SDC RX
        options: 0x0, priority: -10 timeout: 536890152
        state: pending
        stack size 1024, unused 848, usage 176 / 1024 (17 %)
...
```

## Listing all commands

To list all available commands, use the Tab key, which is normally used for the
command completion feature.

Pressing the Tab key in an empty command line prints the list of available
commands:

```shell
uart:~$
  clear              date               device             flash
  help               history            kernel             nrf_clock_control
  ot                 resize             shell
```

Pressing the Tab key with a command entered in the command line cycles through
available options for the given command.

## Using OpenThread commands

[OpenThread commands](https://github.com/openthread/openthread/blob/master/src/cli/README.md)
are also accessible from the shell. However, they must preceded by `ot`. For
example:

```shell
uart:~$ ot masterkey
00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff
Done
```

## Using Matter-specific commands

The nRF Connect examples let you use several Matter-specific CLI commands.

These commands are not available by default and to enable using them, set the
`CONFIG_CHIP_LIB_SHELL=y` Kconfig option in the `prj.conf` file of the given
example.

Every invoked command must be preceded by the `matter` prefix.

See the following subsections for the description of each Matter-specific
command.

### device

Handles a group of commands that are used to manage the device. You must use
this command together with one of the additional subcommands listed below.

#### factoryreset

Performs device factory reset that is hardware reset preceded by erasing of the
whole Matter settings stored in a non-volatile memory.

```shell
uart:~$ matter device factoryreset
Performing factory reset ...
```

### onboardingcodes

Handles a group of commands that are used to view information about device
onboarding codes. The `onboardingcodes` command takes one required parameter for
the rendezvous type, then an optional parameter for printing a specific type of
onboarding code.

The full format of the command is:

```
onboardingcodes none|softap|ble|onnetwork [qrcode|qrcodeurl|manualpairingcode]
```

To print all the onboardingcodes:

```shell
uart:~$ matter onboardingcodes none
QRCode:             MT:W0GU2OTB00KA0648G00
QRCodeUrl:          https://project-chip.github.io/connectedhomeip/qrcode.html?data=MT%3AW0GU2OTB00KA0648G00
ManualPairingCode:  34970112332
```

To print a specific type of onboarding code:

#### qrcode
