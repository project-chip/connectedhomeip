# Building Silicon Labs EFR32 examples

Developers can start prototyping with Matter today. Silicon Labs offers a number
of examples using Matter, such as
[smart locks](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples/lock-app/efr32),
[smart lights](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples/lighting-app/efr32),
and
[window coverings](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples/window-app/efr32).
Matter simplifies the developer experience by maximizing the interoperability of
IoT devices across different vendors, so developers can focus on innovating.

The full list of examples can be found
[here](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples).
The GitHub repository also includes tools for testing your Matter project.
