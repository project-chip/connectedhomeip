# Building Silicon Labs EFR32 examples

Developers can start prototyping with Matter today. Silicon Labs offers a number
of examples using Matter, such as
[smart locks](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples/lock-app/efr32),
[smart lights](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples/lighting-app/efr32),
and
[window coverings](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples/window-app/efr32).
Matter simplifies the developer experience by maximizing the interoperability of
IoT devices across different vendors, so developers can focus on innovating.

The full list of examples can be found
[here](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples).
The GitHub repository also includes tools for testing your Matter project.

## Silicon Labs Matter Github

Silicon Laboratories now maintains a public matter GitHub repo with frequent
releases thoroughly tested and validated. Developers looking to develop matter
products with silabs hardware are encouraged to use our latest release with
added tools and documentation.
