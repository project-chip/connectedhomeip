== Typographic and Syntactic Conventions

The following syntactic conventions are used throughout this document:

_shall_::

is used to indicate a mandatory rule or guideline that must be adhered
to without exception to claim compliance with this specification.

_should_::

is used to indicate a rule or guideline that serves as a strong
preference to suggested practice and is to be followed in the absence of
a compelling reason to do otherwise.

_may_::

is used to indicate a rule or guideline that serves as a reference to
suggested practice.

== Introduction

There are likely as many unique combinations of software engineering and
development standards, conventions, and practices as there organizations
that do such work. This document pulls together those that Project
Connected Home over IP believes best for our organization, its efforts,
and products that consume those efforts, with a particular emphasis on
embedded systems with C or C{plusplus} language development and runtime
environments.

This document and requirements should be considered canonical for all
Project Connected Home over IP shared infrastructure software, including
both RTOS-based and non-RTOS-based projects on both tightly- and
loosely-constrained system platforms.

The document is broadly categorized at the highest level into:

* Best Practices and Conventions
* Format and Style

And, within conventions, further sub-categorized into those that apply
to:

* Tightly-constrained
* Loosely-constrained

system platforms. Applicability to tightly-constrained systems also
generally applies to shared infrastructure software that is used on both
tightly- and loosely-constrained systems.

link:#id.jzphr1iiku89[Figure 1 below] attempts to illustrate both
qualitative and quantitative applicability of these guidelines to
Project Connected Home over IP software.

Generally, product-specific applications have the greatest flexibility
and latitude in applying these guidelines to their software. Whereas,
shared infrastructure bears the least flexibility and bears the greatest
adherence to these guidelines.

== Standards

Project CHIP embedded software development adopts the minimum C and C{plusplus}
standards listed in Table 2.1 below.

|Language |Minimum Standard |Aliases

|===
[.text-center]
*Table 2.1.* C and C{plusplus} language minimum standards adopted by Project CHIP
software.

Product-specific software may elect to use later standards to the extent
their software is not broadly shared inside or outside Project CHIP.

=== C

Project CHIP embedded software development uses and enforces the
ISO9899:1999 (aka ISO C99, C99) C language standard as the minimum.

Wherever possible, particularly in non-product-specific,
shared-infrastructure software, toolchain-specific (e.g GCC/GNU)
extensions or the use of later standards shall be avoided or shall be
leveraged through toolchain-compatibility preprocessor macros.

==== Motivation and Rationale

At the time of this writing, the C99 standard has been out for over 20
years. Project CHIP and both the new and contributed source code that
comprise it have only existed for the last seven to eight of those
20-plus years.

This is beyond more than adequate time for this standard to be pervasive
throughout any toolchain vendor’s C compiler and saves team members from
worrying about ISO9899:1990 (aka ISO C90, C90) portability issues that
have long-since been solved by C99.

=== C{plusplus}

Project CHIP embedded software development uses the ISO14882:2011 (aka
ISO C{plusplus}11) language standard as a baseline for source code
compatibility. Conformance with other standards, for example, ISO14882:1998
(aka ISO C{plusplus}98), may be additionally required in cases where wider
portability is necessary, but in all cases, ISO C{plusplus}11 is the baseline
requirement.

Wherever possible, particularly in non-product-specific,
shared-infrastructure software, toolchain-specific (e.g GCC/GNU)
extensions or the use of later standards shall be avoided or shall be
leveraged through toolchain-compatibility preprocessor macros.

==== Motivation and Rationale

At the time of this writing, the C{plusplus}11 standard has been out for over
seven years in one form or another and has been twice supplanted, once
by C{plusplus}14 and again by C{plusplus}17. Project CHIP and the source code it has
produced are nearly concurrent with C{plusplus}11.

This is beyond more than adequate time for this standard to be pervasive
throughout any toolchain vendor’s C{plusplus} compiler and saves team members
from worrying about portability issues that have long-since been solved
by C{plusplus}11.

By contrast, ISO14882:2014 (aka ISO C{plusplus}14, C{plusplus}14) and ISO14882:2017 (aka
ISO C{plusplus}17, C{plusplus}17), are still insufficiently broad and pervasive in their
toolchain support to warrant the introduction of dependencies on these
standards across all software.

Note, that while C{plusplus}11 is the C{plusplus} language bar, per Figure 1, embrace of
C{plusplus}11 language- and library-specific features should be approached
thoughtfully and carefully, depending on the deployment context. A
loosely-constrained embedded Linux or Darwin application may want a
broad embrace of C{plusplus}11 language and library features whereas a
tightly-constrained piece of shared infrastructure may want to eschew
C{plusplus}11 entirely or conditionally depend on language-specific features,
where appropriate.

That said, suitable portability mnemonics, for example, via the C
preprocessor should be used where possible and appropriate to maximize
code portability, particularly for shared embedded product software. An
example of such a portability mnemonic is shown in Listing 2.1 below.

[source,C]
----
#ifdef __cplusplus
# if __cplusplus >= 201103L
# define __chipFINAL final
# else
# define __chipFINAL
# endif
#else
#define __chipFINAL
#endif
----

== Conventions and Best Practices

=== Common

The following sections summarize those best practices that are
independent of particular nuances of either the C or C{plusplus} languages.

==== When in Rome

The most important convention and practice in the Project CHIP embedded
software is "_When in Rome..._", per the quote below.

[quote, St. Ambrose]
____
If you should be in Rome, live in the Roman manner; if you should be
elsewhere, live as they do there.
____

===== Motivation and Rationale

At this stage in the work group’s and the team’s life cycle, it is rare
the project or subsystem that is entirely new and built from scratch.
More often than not, development will involve extending, enhancing, and
fixing existing code in existing projects.

When in this situation, it is mandatory you observe how things are done
in this context and do the best that you can to follow the prevailing
conventions present. Not doing so can lead to readability and
maintenance problems down the line and will likely earn you the
disapprobation of the code’s _owner_ or other team members.

Your extensions or fixes to existing code should be *indistinguishable*,
stylistically, from the original code such that the only way to
ascertain ownership and responsibility is to use the source code control
system’s change attribution (aka _blame_) feature.

If you find the conventions so foreign or otherwise confusing, it may be
best to let whoever owns the file make the necessary changes or seek the
counsel of others in the group to find out what the right thing to do
is. Never just start changing code wholesale for personal reasons
without consulting others first.

==== Language-independent

===== Commenting Out or Disabling Code

Unused code shall not be disabled by commenting it out with C- or
C{plusplus}-style comments or with preprocessor `#if 0 ... #endif` semantics.

====== Motivation and Rationale

Code should either be actively maintained and "in" the source base for a
purpose or removed entirely. Code that is disabled in this way is
generally sloppy and does not convey a sense of certainty and direction
in the code.

Anyone who is interested in the history of a particular source code file
should use the source code control system to browse it.

Code that is debug- or test-only should be moved to a conditionally
compiled test source file or conditionalized with an appropriate
`WITH_DEBUG`, `WANT_DEBUG`, `WITH_TESTS`, `WANT_TESTS`, or some similar such
preprocessor mnemonic that can be asserted from the build system.

===== Use C _stdint.h_ or C{plusplus} _cstdint_ for Plain Old Data Types

Standard, scalar data types defined in _stdint.h_ \(C) or _cstdint_ (C{plusplus})
should be used for basic signed and unsigned integer types, especially
when size and serialization to non-volatile storage or across a network
is concerned.

Examples of these are: `uint8_t`, `int8_t`, etc.

====== Motivation and Rationale

These types have been effectively standardized since C99 and should be
available on every platform and provide more neutral portability than
OS-specific types such as `u8`, `UInt8`, etc. Moreover, because these are
pervasive, you do not need to spend any time and energy as a developer
and engineer creating more such types on your own—the compiler vendors
have already done the hard work for you.

Additionally, using traditional scalar types such as `char`, `int`, `short`, or
`long` have portability issues where data width is concerned because these
types are either signed- or sized-differently on different processor
architectures and and ABIs for those architectures. For example, a char is signed
on some architectures and unsigned on others and a long is 32-bits on some
architectures and 64-bits on others.

==== Language-dependent

=====	C{plusplus}

======	Avoid `using namespace` Statements in Headers

By doing this, you are effectively forcing every other module that
includes the header to also be using the namespace. This causes
namespace pollution and generally defeats the purposes of namespaces.
Fully-qualified symbols should be used instead.
