== Typographic and Syntactic Conventions

The following syntactic conventions are used throughout this document:

_shall_::

is used to indicate a mandatory rule or guideline that must be adhered
to without exception to claim compliance with this specification.

_should_::

is used to indicate a rule or guideline that serves as a strong
preference to suggested practice and is to be followed in the absence of
a compelling reason to do otherwise.

_may_::

is used to indicate a rule or guideline that serves as a reference to
suggested practice.

== Introduction

There are likely as many unique combinations of software engineering and
development standards, conventions, and practices as there organizations
that do such work. This document pulls together those that Project
Connected Home over IP believes best for our organization, its efforts,
and products that consume those efforts, with a particular emphasis on
embedded systems with C or C{plusplus} language development and runtime
environments.

This document and requirements should be considered canonical for all
Project Connected Home over IP shared infrastructure software, including
both RTOS-based and non-RTOS-based projects on both tightly- and
loosely-constrained system platforms.

The document is broadly categorized at the highest level into:

* Best Practices and Conventions
* Format and Style

And, within conventions, further sub-categorized into those that apply
to:

* Tightly-constrained
* Loosely-constrained

system platforms. Applicability to tightly-constrained systems also
generally applies to shared infrastructure software that is used on both
tightly- and loosely-constrained systems.

link:#id.jzphr1iiku89[Figure 1 below] attempts to illustrate both
qualitative and quantitative applicability of these guidelines to
Project Connected Home over IP software.

Generally, product-specific applications have the greatest flexibility
and latitude in applying these guidelines to their software. Whereas,
shared infrastructure bears the least flexibility and bears the greatest
adherence to these guidelines.

== Standards

Project CHIP embedded software development adopts the minimum C and C{plusplus}
standards listed in Table 2.1 below.

[[t.4d8bfeef046f29261fc72f1a903d6d10a909957a]][[t.2]]

[cols=3,options="header"]
|===
|Language |Minimum Standard |Aliases

|C{plusplus}|ISO14882:2011|ISO C{plusplus}11, C{plusplus}11
|===
[.text-center]
*Table 2.1.* C and C{plusplus} language minimum standards adopted by Project CHIP
software.

Product-specific software may elect to use later standards to the extent
their software is not broadly shared inside or outside Project CHIP.

=== C

Project CHIP embedded software development uses and enforces the
ISO9899:1999 (aka ISO C99, C99) C language standard as the minimum.

Wherever possible, particularly in non-product-specific,
shared-infrastructure software, toolchain-specific (e.g GCC/GNU)
extensions or the use of later standards shall be avoided or shall be
leveraged through toolchain-compatibility preprocessor macros.

==== Motivation and Rationale

At the time of this writing, the C99 standard has been out for over 20
years. Project CHIP and both the new and contributed source code that
comprise it have only existed for the last seven to eight of those
20-plus years.

This is beyond more than adequate time for this standard to be pervasive
throughout any toolchain vendor’s C compiler and saves team members from
worrying about ISO9899:1990 (aka ISO C90, C90) portability issues that
have long-since been solved by C99.

=== C{plusplus}

Project CHIP embedded software development uses the ISO14882:2011 (aka
ISO C{plusplus}11) language standard as a baseline for source code
compatibility. Conformance with other standards, for example, ISO14882:1998
(aka ISO C{plusplus}98), may be additionally required in cases where wider
portability is necessary, but in all cases, ISO C{plusplus}11 is the baseline
requirement.

Wherever possible, particularly in non-product-specific,
shared-infrastructure software, toolchain-specific (e.g GCC/GNU)
extensions or the use of later standards shall be avoided or shall be
leveraged through toolchain-compatibility preprocessor macros.

==== Motivation and Rationale

At the time of this writing, the C{plusplus}11 standard has been out for over
seven years in one form or another and has been twice supplanted, once
by C{plusplus}14 and again by C{plusplus}17. Project CHIP and the source code it has
produced are nearly concurrent with C{plusplus}11.

This is beyond more than adequate time for this standard to be pervasive
throughout any toolchain vendor’s C{plusplus} compiler and saves team members
from worrying about portability issues that have long-since been solved
by C{plusplus}11.

By contrast, ISO14882:2014 (aka ISO C{plusplus}14, C{plusplus}14) and ISO14882:2017 (aka
ISO C{plusplus}17, C{plusplus}17), are still insufficiently broad and pervasive in their
toolchain support to warrant the introduction of dependencies on these
standards across all software.

Note, that while C{plusplus}11 is the C{plusplus} language bar, per Figure 1, embrace of
C{plusplus}11 language- and library-specific features should be approached
thoughtfully and carefully, depending on the deployment context. A
loosely-constrained embedded Linux or Darwin application may want a
broad embrace of C{plusplus}11 language and library features whereas a
tightly-constrained piece of shared infrastructure may want to eschew
C{plusplus}11 entirely or conditionally depend on language-specific features,
where appropriate.

That said, suitable portability mnemonics, for example, via the C
preprocessor should be used where possible and appropriate to maximize
code portability, particularly for shared embedded product software. An
example of such a portability mnemonic is shown in Listing 2.1 below.

[source,C]

#ifdef __cplusplus
# if __cplusplus >= 201103L
# define __chipFINAL final
# else
# define __chipFINAL
# endif
#else
#define __chipFINAL
#endif

for the C{plusplus}11 and later final keyword.

== Conventions and Best Practices

=== Common

The following sections summarize those best practices that are
independent of particular nuances of either the C or C{plusplus} languages.

==== When in Rome

The most important convention and practice in the Project CHIP embedded
software is "_When in Rome..._", per the quote below.

[quote, St. Ambrose]
____
If you should be in Rome, live in the Roman manner; if you should be
elsewhere, live as they do there.
____

===== Motivation and Rationale

At this stage in the work group’s and the team’s life cycle, it is rare
the project or subsystem that is entirely new and built from scratch.
More often than not, development will involve extending, enhancing, and
fixing existing code in existing projects.

When in this situation, it is mandatory you observe how things are done
in this context and do the best that you can to follow the prevailing
conventions present. Not doing so can lead to readability and
maintenance problems down the line and will likely earn you the
disapprobation of the code’s _owner_ or other team members.

Your extensions or fixes to existing code should be *indistinguishable*,
stylistically, from the original code such that the only way to
ascertain ownership and responsibility is to use the source code control
system’s change attribution (aka _blame_) feature.

If you find the conventions so foreign or otherwise confusing, it may be
best to let whoever owns the file make the necessary changes or seek the
counsel of others in the group to find out what the right thing to do
is. Never just start changing code wholesale for personal reasons
without consulting others first.

==== Language-independent

===== Commenting Out or Disabling Code

Unused code shall not be disabled by commenting it out with C- or
C{plusplus}-style comments or with preprocessor `#if 0 ... #endif` semantics.

====== Motivation and Rationale

Code should either be actively maintained and "in" the source base for a
purpose or removed entirely. Code that is disabled in this way is
generally sloppy and does not convey a sense of certainty and direction
in the code.

Anyone who is interested in the history of a particular source code file
should use the source code control system to browse it.

Code that is debug- or test-only should be moved to a conditionally
compiled test source file or conditionalized with an appropriate
`WITH_DEBUG`, `WANT_DEBUG`, `WITH_TESTS`, `WANT_TESTS`, or some similar such
preprocessor mnemonic that can be asserted from the build system.

===== Use C _stdint.h_ or C{plusplus} _cstdint_ for Plain Old Data Types

Standard, scalar data types defined in _stdint.h_ \(C) or _cstdint_ (C{plusplus})
should be used for basic signed and unsigned integer types, especially
when size and serialization to non-volatile storage or across a network
is concerned.

Examples of these are: `uint8_t`, `int8_t`, etc.

====== Motivation and Rationale

These types have been effectively standardized since C99 and should be
available on every platform and provide more neutral portability than
OS-specific types such as `u8`, `UInt8`, etc. Moreover, because these are
pervasive, you do not need to spend any time and energy as a developer
and engineer creating more such types on your own—the compiler vendors
have already done the hard work for you.

Additionally, using traditional scalar types such as `char`, `int`, `short`, or
`long` have portability issues where data width is concerned because these
types are either signed- or sized-differently on different processor
architectures and and ABIs for those architectures. For example, a char is signed
on some architectures and unsigned on others and a long is 32-bits on some
architectures and 64-bits on others.

==== Language-dependent

=====	C{plusplus}

======	Avoid `using namespace` Statements in Headers

By doing this, you are effectively forcing every other module that
includes the header to also be using the namespace. This causes
namespace pollution and generally defeats the purposes of namespaces.
Fully-qualified symbols should be used instead.

=== Tightly-constrained Systems and Shared Infrastructure

Applicability to tightly-constrained systems also generally applies to
shared infrastructure software that is used on both tightly- and
loosely-constrained systems.

==== Avoid Heap-based Resource Allocation

Heap-based resource allocation should be avoided.

===== Motivation and Rationale

As emphasized throughout this document, the software produced by Project
CHIP is consumed both inside and outside Project CHIP, across a variety
of platforms. The capabilities of these platforms are broad, spanning
soft real-time, deeply-embedded systems based on based on RTOSes that
may cover life safety and/or physical security applications to richer,
softly-embedded systems based on non-RTOS platforms such as Darwin or
Linux. While the latter are apt to have fully-functional heaps, the
former explicitly may not.

Consequently, when planning new or extending existing Project CHIP code,
consider the platforms to which the code is targeted. If the platforms
include those deeply-embedded platforms absent functioning heaps, then
heap-based resource allocation is absolutely forbidden. If not,
consideration should be made to the cost / benefit trade-offs of
heap-based allocation and, if possible, it should be avoided using one
of the recommended techniques below.

===== Alternatives

In either case, recommended resource allocation alternatives are:

* In Place Allocation and Initialization
* Pool-based Allocators
* Platform-defined and -assigned Allocators

The interfaces in https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/src/lib/support/CHIPMem.h[_src/lib/support/CHIPMem.h_] provide support for
the latter two alternatives.

====== Use In Place Allocation and Initialization

Regardless of whether the source code and runtime are C or C{plusplus}, the
first step is creating storage for the object being allocated and
initialized. For simple
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_data_structure[plain-old-data
(POD)] data structures, this can be done by just allocating the
structure at an appropriate scope. Alternatively, _raw_ storage can be
allocated and then cast. However, great care must be taken with the
latter approach to ensure that natural machine alignments and language
strict-aliasing rules are observed. With the simple data structure
declaration, the compiler does this on your behalf. With the raw
approach, you must do this.

Once the storage has been allocated, then use symmetric initializers and
deinitializers such as those, for example, for `pthread_attr_t`. An
example is shown in the listing below.

    int              status;
    pthread_t        thread;
    pthread_attr_t * attrs = (pthread_attr_t *)&sThreadAttributes;

    // Now "construct" or initialize the storage.
    retval = pthread_attr_init(attrs);

    if (retval == 0)
    {
        retval = pthread_create(&thread, attrs, foobar_entry, NULL);

        if (retval == 0)
        {
            status = pthread_join(thread, NULL);

            if (status != 0)
            {
                retval = status;
            }

            status = pthread_attr_destroy(attrs);

            if (status != 0)
            {
                retval = status;
            }
        }
    }

    return (retval);
}
----

For non-scalar types and objects such as C{plusplus} classes, this gets slightly
trickier since C{plusplus} constructors and destructors must be accounted for
and invoked. Fortunately, C{plusplus} has placement new which handles this.
The listing below modifies the listing above using C{plusplus} placement new
to ensure the class is properly constructed before initialization and
destructed after deinitialization.

        ta->~ThreadAttributes();
    }

    return retval;

====== Use Pool-based Allocators

In place allocation allows the successful allocation, initialization,
deinitialization, and deallocation of a single object allocated from
preallocated storage. However, if the desire exists for a fixed,
configurable pool of objects where 0 to `n` of such objects can be
allocated at any one time, a pool allocator for that specific object
type must be created.

As shown in the listing below, a pool allocator for a `Foo` class of
`CHIP_FOO_COUNT` objects is effected, assuming the existence of another
helper class, StaticAllocatorBitmap, which uses a bitmap to track the
storage of objects from a static array of storage.

====== Use Platform-defined and -assigned Allocators

This is a variation on both in place allocation and pool-based
allocation in that it completely delegates resource allocation to the
system integrator and the platform on which the particular software
subsystem is running.

The advantage of this approach is that it allows the platform to decide
how resource allocation will be handled and allows the package to scale
independently of platform resource allocation.

The package may define default implementations for a few types of
platform allocation strategies, such as heap-based allocators and
pool-based allocators.

There are a range of granularities for achieving this type of
delegation, depending on the desired size of the API surface, as shown
in the listings below.
