# Using Simplicity Studio's Energy Profiler with Matter

Simplicity Studio's Energy Profiler allows the developer to see a graphical view
of their device's energy usage over time. This can be very useful when
developing an energy-friendly device.

Using Energy Profiler with Matter is the same as any other protocol except that
you need to start the usage from within Energy Profiler inside Simplicity
Studio, rather than using an existing Simplicity Studio project, since your
Matter project will not have been created inside Simplicity Studio.

Complete documentation on using the Simplicity Studio Energy Profiler is
provided in the
[Simplicity Studio 5 Energy Profiler User's Guide](https://docs.silabs.com/simplicity-studio-5-users-guide/1.0/using-the-tools/energy-profiler/)
