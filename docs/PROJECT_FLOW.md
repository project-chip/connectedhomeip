## CHIP Project Flow

This section is intended to cover how CHIP uses GitHub Projects, Issues,
Milestones, Releases, and Branches for program/project management in the code
repository.

### Issues

CHIP uses issues as simple problem descriptions or feature requests. In general,
all work contributed to the repository in the form of pull requests (PR) should
be under the auspices of some open issue. This may seem onerous and in some
cases duplicative, so consider these guidelines when deciding whether to you can
get away with not creating an issue:

-   Trivial fixes: issues can function as TODO lists, simple reminders that
    something should be addressed. Sometimes, though, the work required to fix
    is smaller than the work required to write the issue.
-   Issues intended to be addressed by a PR may not actually be fixed or may
    regress.
-   Issues can span PRs (as PRs should be as small as possible, but no smaller).
-   Issues help form an important basis for release notes. Any PR that addresses
    a problem that should have release visibility, please do open an issue.

### Pull requests

Pull requests should be small and address a single, specific change to the code
base. They should be easy to review, as a "yes, that's better". Refrain from
requesting review until all PR checks have completed successfully, lest you tire
your reviewers.

PR Don'ts:

-   Don't combine unrelated changes. E.g. if the PR addresses a bug in some C
    code, an update to the top-level .gitignore doesn't belong.
-   Don't make stacks. E.g. if a change in a component requires a new feature or
    even a small tweak in one or more of its dependencies, each dependency
    change belongs in its own separate PR.

### Milestones

In CHIP parlance, a milestone is simply an expected due date or release.

Date-based milestones start with an "M" and have the form M3, M3.2, M4, etc.
corresponding to the number of months since January 1, 2020, and generally mean
the last Friday of that month. E.g. M1 corresponds to EOB January 24,

2020. The Morrow milestone is a special milestone that means "unprioritized" or
      "unscheduled" or "unscoped".

The form of the names of release-based milestone names are TBD, and may have
flexible or changing dates.

### Projects

Projects are collections of issues, pull requests, and notes intended to capture
larger efforts that don't fit in issues, have multiple-subsystems involved, or
may span multiple milestones. We use projects 2 ways:

1. To track burn down on a larger task. When constructing such a project, it's
   important to think in terms of something that will eventually have an end,
   i.e. a definite scope.
2. To categorize issues, denote broader efforts without a definite time scope.
   These projects might reflect or show burndown or percent complete, but are
   mostly used to view where effort is going.

Issues can belong to any number of projects, but should generally only belong to
one of the task-tracking projects (the first type).

### Branches, releases, and general development flow

Master should always be CHIPs best branch. Release branches, once cut, are
closed for any feature work. Software fixes for release branches must first land
on master unless demonstrably infeasible.
