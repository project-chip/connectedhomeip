      # Unfortunately current syntax for github wrapper actions only work for
      # Javascript actions, and Docker container actions, which doesn't make it
      # possible to wrap a shell script like the one below. The action below
      # essentially wraps the shell commands we want to run into a Javascript
      # wrapped action. This allow us to get the disk info usage before a job
      # is run and after the job is run regardless if the job succeeds or
      # fails.
