name: Build example - NuttX

on:
  # NuttX disabled: it maintains an out-of-source build that cannot be fixed by SDK updates.
  #
  # In particular the build is NOT valid:
  #   https://github.com/apache/nuttx-apps/blob/f000ed733fc749004cbf0922fbf036abedbe91cf/netutils/connectedhomeip/CMakeLists.txt#L175
  #
  # adds `src/app/util/mock` as standard includes, which essentially overrides real light example builds.
  #
  # Will need re-enabling once NuttX integrations are more stable and SDK CI can be fixed without requiring upstream NuttX changes.
