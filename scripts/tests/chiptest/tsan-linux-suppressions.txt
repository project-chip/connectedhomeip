# The Linux server app ends up with a data race in libglib.  A race_top
# suppression does not work, since the actual race is inside a memset, so the
# thing on top of the stack is memset.  called_from_lib is a narrower
# suppression than a "race" suppression (which would be "libglib anywhere on the
# stack", as opposed to "inside a function TSan intercepts, which was called
# from libglib).
#
# See https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/issues/14710 for
# addressing this.
